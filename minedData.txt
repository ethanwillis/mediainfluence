We’re just American Gladiators navigating an obstacle course of bigotry, bullying and rejection. In a theatrical or literary context, this makes some sense: Coming out provides conflict; it makes good drama.\nBut the brilliance of As One, the new chamber opera that had its world premiere this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is that the drama is (mostly) internal. With only one character, Hannah, that choice allows for a complex and nuanced portrayal of the coming out experience on stage. There are no “there’s something I have to tell you” scenes, no dramatization of strained relationships. Hannah doesn’t have to justify her identity to the outside world. Instead, drama is wrung from the obstacle course within, where she must scale mountains of confusion, transverse gulfs of isolation and dodge bullets of self-doubt.\nThe story of Hannah is inspired in part by the story of Kimberly Reed, a filmmaker and Out100 honoree, whose 2008 documPresented by American Opera Projects. Photo by Ken Howardentary Prodigal Sons explored her transition from male to female and the strained relationship with her adopted brother. Reed is a co-librettist here, sharing the writing credit with Mark Campbell. The simplicity of their language gives the opera a stream-of-consciousness ease and accessibility; they prefer small, sometimes humorous, personal observations to the sweeping pronouncements often favored by opera librettos.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"themostlyclosetedteen","id":97546755190,"post_url":"http://themostlyclosetedteen.tumblr.com/post/97546755190/when-someone-makes-a-transphobic-joke-in-front-of-me","slug":"when-someone-makes-a-transphobic-joke-in-front-of-me","type":"text","date":"2014-09-15 05:48:59 GMT","timestamp":1410760139,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"jumkjBnP","tags":["transphobia","but I can never say anything because Im not out","trans","help me"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zwcoom1QsFLns","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"title":"When someone makes a transphobic joke in front of me","body":"","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"themostlyclosetedteen","id":97546654560,"post_url":"http://themostlyclosetedteen.tumblr.com/post/97546654560/whenever-someone-brings-up-trans-issues-in-conversation","slug":"whenever-someone-brings-up-trans-issues-in-conversation","type":"text","date":"2014-09-15 05:47:06 GMT","timestamp":1410760026,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"xg4TiMjx","tags":["ftm","trans","trans topics","closeted","themostlyclosetedteen","gif","reactio gif","hmm","whenever this happens I feel like Im undercover figuring out who I can come out to"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zwcoom1QsEzDW","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":26,"title":"Whenever someone brings up trans issues in conversation","body":"","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"erikabeebee","id":97546595867,"post_url":"http://erikabeebee.tumblr.com/post/97546595867/how-are-you-going-to-have-sex-with-your-boyfriend-if","slug":"how-are-you-going-to-have-sex-with-your-boyfriend-if","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-15 05:45:00 GMT","timestamp":1410759900,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"0emGr5Jf","tags":["trans","transphobia","trans man","ftm transgender","boyfriend","i love him","so much"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZpiWwx1QsEkuR","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":11,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"how are you going to have sex with your \"boyfriend\" if she's a fucking GIRL?","answer":"how are you going to survive if you’re so fucking DUMB?\n\nthis message is wrong on so many levels. first off, you just misgendered my boyfriend, and that is really fucked up. he is a MAN. \n\nsecond of all, even if i was dating a woman, would you really not understand how we would have sex? is your idea of sex really just a dick being rammed into a vagina over and over again?

It worries me because I value control and with hrt I have to trust. I have to place my trust in a second puberty when the first was for all purposes disfiguring. I would hope that the second would be relieving and rid me of my dysphoria or at least some of it. But I don’t know. Will I see the dramatic results that some of my trans sisters have seen? I don’t know. Will it help the world see me as the woman I am or will it leave me in some middle state? I don’t know. Will it be able to do enough to “fix” the damage that testosterone has done? I don’t know. I hate the fact that all the hrt guides and knowledge bases have told me everything that wont change and all the rest is “ymmv” aka good luck. I get why that is necessary but still it doesn’t help a mind that worries. Also the guides and advice and knowledge is all over the place. No two sources agree on everything. \n\nAlso I have been told 1000 times that I shouldn’t care if I pass or not, but I do. I am not hoping to be a super model. Hell I don’t even care if I am “attractive.” I just hope hrt lets me live the rest of my life as an ordinary woman. I only care that I can be treated like a woman and more over a person. I just want to be another face in the crowd. Another woman on her way to work or out for a stroll. I am scared that I wont pass and will be forever treated as a monster or something to be mocked, ridiculed and disgusted of.\n\nBut what scares me the most is that I am going through with it. Because it feels like my only option. I have wanted this for as long as I knew it was a thing. Since I was in 8th grade and I was holding that birth control pill and I knew it had hormones in it and all I could think was maybe it would make me a girl. I knew then. I knew before then. I knew after then. I know now. I just hope I’m not too late. I know its never too late to live an honest life but I just hope I can right this ship and still have a life. I have to trust in the hrt. I have to trust in people. I have to trust in my family. And I am going to have to trust myself. I’m going to have to trust. A lot.

always felt connected to the transgender community because I grew up in a small, conservative, southern town where it was a constant struggle to feel comfortable in my own skin.\n\nOkay so I am hate-reading this author’s interviews and here’s a quote. It’s not the only place she’s said this, it’s come up in multiple interviews.\n\nLook. Let me preface with your experience is not my experience. That said:\n\nI grew up in the South. Plenty conservative, considering my high school principal resigned over us trying to start a GSA.\n\nFeeling comfortable in one’s skin? While many people want to fold in the T with the LGB, and some experiences are similar - gender identity is not sexual orientation.\n\nTrying not to get caught looking in the locker room, wondering why you get that feeling in your stomach when your best friend’s hand presses on your shoulder - not similar at all to being called the wrong name, being forced into the wrong bathroom, being surrounded by an entire world of people who don’t understand you.\n\nAt least there’s a word for girl who likes girls, even if it’s whispered, even if it’s a slur and written on the bathroom stalls. That is at least a word you can put into Google or look up in the dictionary; a place to start. In the small town, conservative South, there’s no word for “when puberty feels wrong” and “why don’t i look like the other gender no matter how hard i wish at night.”\n\nI really cannot believe the gall of this author to say she empathizes with the trans community, that the discrimination we face keeps her up at night in anger, and that’s her motivation to write this book. Wow, must be nice to have such mental fortitude to get to anger - because you’re not in fear, or sorrow, or anger from being helpless because you’re held back by a system designed to work against you.\n\nForget all that - you’re profiting off the backs of the very community you sought advice from for this goddamn book, and then silenced. Maybe giving a portion of the proceeds to the local LGBT youth charity was guilt, but I doubt it. You just want to be a better ally to the community.\n\nYou’re no ally of mine.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sink-swim-orsimply-disappear","id":97536439484,"post_url":"http://sink-swim-orsimply-disappear.tumblr.com/post/97536439484","slug":"","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-15 03:22:36 GMT","timestamp":1410751356,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"dcetdHfF","tags":["trans","lgbt"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZGFctn1Qrd-Iy","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"caption":"","image_permalink":"http://sink-swim-orsimply-disappear.tumblr.com/image/97536439484","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":293,"height":403,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/4ccdc0eb3f13556affb95b0bcf5df51f/tumblr_naz8ktt6Sl1ty8d5bo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":344,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/4ccdc0eb3f13556affb95b0bcf5df51f/tumblr_naz8ktt6Sl1ty8d5bo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":138,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/4ccdc0eb3f13556affb95b0bcf5df51f/tumblr_naz8ktt6Sl1ty8d5bo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/4ccdc0eb3f13556affb95b0bcf5df51f/tumblr_naz8ktt6Sl1ty8d5bo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":293,"height":403,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/4ccdc0eb3f13556affb95b0bcf5df51f/tumblr_naz8ktt6Sl1ty8d5bo1_400.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"andthenigaveyouclothes","id":97536076827,"post_url":"http://andthenigaveyouclothes.tumblr.com/post/97536076827/opinion-question","slug":"opinion-question","type":"text","date":"2014-09-15 03:18:13 GMT","timestamp":1410751093,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"fqZ9ZHKk","tags":["trans","pronouns","question","cisgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZFnlAq1QrccmR","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"opinion question","body":"So I’ve noticed a lot of cis people using pronouns other than the ones that match their gender.

this story isn’t really new or recent, but I feel like it needed to be told.\n\n  Last year, I came out as transgender to my parents (female to male)…I was extremely nervous, scared terrified. I knew for a fact that they wouldn’t kick me out or disown me, but I didn’t know exactly how they would react. I was expecting them to question me or try to change me etc. But instead this is how the conversation went:\n\nMe: *big long speech about gender vs. sex…you don’t have to like it, you just have to love me….i can’t change who i am….I’m still the same me… please love me etc….*\nMom: Okay, cool….and what would our new son like for supper….I was thinking tacos…that cool with you?\nMe: O___o *speechless*\nMom: The way I look at it….When I was pregnant with you, I would have been happy if you had been a boy or a girl….All I wanted was a healthy, happy baby to love….Why should that be different 16 years later?\n\n  Moral of the story: i have the best mom in the world Yes, some parents are simple-minded, but not all of them. Be who want to be; be who you are. If they don’t “love” you after you actually start being you, then there’s an extra bedroom at my place for you to crash in.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"kixxiija","id":97532812125,"post_url":"http://kixxiija.tumblr.com/post/97532812125/140915-trans-all4b2uty-cr-yongjunna","slug":"140915-trans-all4b2uty-cr-yongjunna","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-15 02:39:36 GMT","timestamp":1410748776,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"VNpW3Dmc","tags":["BEAST","b2st","Yoseob","Yoseop","trans","twitter","@all4b2uty","140915"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZNmIyr1QrQ9jT","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":5,"caption":"140915 [TRANS] @all4b2uty\n\n \ncr: @yongjunna","image_permalink":"http://kixxiija.tumblr.com/image/97532812125","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":640,"height":895,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":699,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":559,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":350,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":140,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":640,"height":895,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bd74bfebb71b7af3de186f271fe2a6bf/tumblr_nbx8q0gs3E1stwlhqo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"cishaming","id":97532617835,"post_url":"http://cishaming.tumblr.com/post/97532617835/here-is-your-reminder-that-gender-special-is","slug":"here-is-your-reminder-that-gender-special-is","type":"text","date":"2014-09-15 02:37:00 GMT","timestamp":1410748620,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"ySm3bWHJ","tags":["alice is talking again","trans","tucute"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZNSLCo1QrPQHh","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":97,"title":"","body":"Here is your reminder that “gender special” is founded in making fun of trans people with mental disabilities.

She received the majority of votes from her classmates and was given the honor during yesterday’s, 12 September, school football game.\n\n'It was really exciting. It felt really good. I couldn't stop smiling,' she said, according to the Associated Press, after finding out about the vote.\n\nInitially, she was surprised by her nomination. There were three other nominees.\n\n'One of my friends mentioned it, and I didn't think anything of it because I didn't think I'd be nominated. But, now, it really matters to me,' the student said.\n\n'This is something I've wanted to do since my freshman year. I want people to be themselves and not feel uncomfortable in their own body and mind.'\n\nSand Creek High is located Colorado Springs. The leaders of the district, Falcon School District 49, released a statement supporting the selection.\n\n'The leaders at Sand Creek High School and in District 49 respect the decision of the Scorpion student body in electing their homecoming court,' district spokesman Matt Meister said, as reported by the AP.\n\n'Our board policy sets the standard that we do not exclude any person from participating in any program or activity on the basis of gender identity and gender

sorry, but how would you ever expect a straight girl to date you?","answer":"Well first I’d ask on her on a date silly.\n\nHowever, that isn’t the question you are asking.\n\nThe simple answer is I’d treat her well and like a lady and all I would ask in return is she respects who I am, and that is plainly a man. \n\nThe compound answer of “but your body is abcd.. and she wants efgh” is simple to me too. I am a work in progress, and so is everyone else. If a girl only dates a guy because she absolutely needs “real flesh made at birth penis” then I suppose she would not date me. However, dating someone is about so much more than one anatomical part. It’s about holding hands while you watch tv, wrapping your arms around someone, feeling each others heart race when you see one and other, kissing, etc. Those crucial relationship peices are not based in gender. \n\nI am a man, no more or less then anyone else. But i am honest about my past always. But frankly not part of dating me is like dating a girl- I would know, I date them! And if someone can’t accept my past then that has nothing to do with orientation but sexual preference and that is just a whole different subject. \n\nSo yeah, a straight girl could date me and they already have before. Simply because we work well and enjoy each other’s company- and that’s what makes relationships.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"degaussoline","id":97523786051,"post_url":"http://degaussoline.tumblr.com/post/97523786051/im-gonna-use-the-t-slur-when-im-dfab-because-its","slug":"im-gonna-use-the-t-slur-when-im-dfab-because-its","type":"text","date":"2014-09-15 00:51:26 GMT","timestamp":1410742286,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"4FKiUYSO","tags":["trans","transgender","sighs","personal"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zj1fam1Qqtk53","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"im gonna use the t slur when im dfab because its been used against me in a derogatory manner, thanks","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"zucchinihutjr","id":97523738645,"post_url":"http://zucchinihutjr.tumblr.com/post/97523738645/ftm-trans-vitamint-voicechanges","slug":"ftm-trans-vitamint-voicechanges","type":"video","date":"2014-09-15 00:50:50 GMT","timestamp":1410742250,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"EsmayxGX","tags":["voicechanges","vitamint","trans","ftm","onemonthontestosterone"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZiKaow1QqtYWL","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"caption":"#ftm #trans #vitamint #voicechanges #onemonthontestosterone","permalink_url":"http://instagram.com/p/s8lijngi13","html5_capable":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://instagram.com/p/s8lijngi13/media/?size=l","thumbnail_width":640,"thumbnail_height":640,"player":[{"width":250,"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://instagram.com/p/s8lijngi13/embed\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>"},{"width":400,"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://instagram.com/p/s8lijngi13/embed\" width=\"400\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>"},{"width":500,"embed_code":"<iframe src=\"http://instagram.com/p/s8lijngi13/embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>"}],"video_type":"instagram","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"whomyoumayknow","id":97522900824,"post_url":"http://whomyoumayknow.tumblr.com/post/97522900824/1-in-5-times-a-man-cant-buy-the-morning-after-pill","slug":"1-in-5-times-a-man-cant-buy-the-morning-after-pill","type":"link","date":"2014-09-15 00:40:00 GMT","timestamp":1410741600,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"0bBopG2C","tags":["trans","reprojustice","transgender","trans men","ftm","ftmpregnancy"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zdb8By1QqqLzO","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":5,"title":"1 In 5 Times, A Man Can't Buy The Morning-After Pill","url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/morning-after-pill-men-access_n_5807156.html","link_image":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_nbx370TqbA1qdo0yk_og.jpg","description":"If a guy needs to buy the morning-after pill for a female friend, he’s going to need to rely on a fair amount of luck.

I always think “It’s that one day where I’m celebrated! Me! Woo!” And then always get… disappointed I guess you could say. A year ago, I was a wreck. I was dirt broke, couldn’t afford heat in my house, nowhere to live, taking handouts from friends, my mom had just passed away from cancer, and I was just struggling to get through day to day. Sitting here today, I’m a year on hormones, Passing everyday, my surgery appointments for SRS are all scheduled practically for next year, I’m in university, walked away from //another// car accident that should’ve killed me, and I’m sitting here with basically no worries. Everything that can be going right, practically is. \n\nIt’s my birthday. So why do I feel like shit? Like I’m alone? Like I’m not important in any of my friends lives? That even though I’m finally achieving success and proud of myself for once, that it still doesn’t matter? I’m happy with so much in my life, and figured that once I had myself figured out, then I could meet people, become friends with people, develop relationships with people and just… thrive. University set my hopes so high, that maybe I’d find like-minded people here. So far… Nope. I’ve been nothing but that “One trans person in history class that contributes a lot” \n\nThe simple answer is I’m fucking lonely. I realize this. I //know// this. I have so many awesome friends that are the best people in the world, but I dont feel important enough to them. I have two friends locally that I haven’t spoken to face to face in months. Everyone else is online. It’s been almost a year and a half since I’ve had anything resembling a relationship, but because of my transition, it dosen’t exactly put me in a very sought for spot in society. I haven’t had anyone I could call a “perspective partner” in forever.\n\nI’m unhappy, but I know //why// and I know what I //need// But I cant fucking get it.

The word “homophobia” was coined in 1972, when George Weinberg was trying to figure out what had happened during the nazi regime. A man (if you can call him that) named Heinrich Himmler hated gay men and had over 100 thousand gay men arrested, half of which were imprisoned with many going to concentration camps. Gay men and suspected gay men even had to wear special arm bands with a pink triangle on it. It is believed Himmler hated gay men because he thought they were weak and “like women” and would ruin the “Aryan” race. So Weinberg used the term “homophobia” to describe this and described it as being an actual fear of being “gay” by the very fact that you associated with gay men, “fear of contagion”, that maybe you could “catch” the gay. Basically, it’s more a fear that your masculinity would be questioned, rather than a legitimate fear of actual gay men individually. Anyway, it’s now (well, and then obviously but they didn’t use the term as loosely as we do now) used as a justification of acting like a dickhead and used to explain why someone would commit a hate crime. It’s not an excuse and I’m just sharing this because I think the origins of where these words and expressions we use today came from are fascinating. But regardless and in conclusion, this quote still holds true, you are a complete asshole if you think your masculinity, or femininity, would be in question if you just let people of another sexuality than you just live their life the way they see fit.","image_permalink":"http://redheadtalkinginallcaps.tumblr.com/image/97520556196","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":500,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/30c0041bd3bbfc3301a48e5373427962/tumblr_nbx1s55fAs1qjad5so1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/30c0041bd3bbfc3301a48e5373427962/tumblr_nbx1s55fAs1qjad5so1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":375,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/30c0041bd3bbfc3301a48e5373427962/tumblr_nbx1s55fAs1qjad5so1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":150,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/30c0041bd3bbfc3301a48e5373427962/tumblr_nbx1s55fAs1qjad5so1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/30c0041bd3bbfc3301a48e5373427962/tumblr_nbx1s55fAs1qjad5so1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":500,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/30c0041bd3bbfc3301a48e5373427962/tumblr_nbx1s55fAs1qjad5so1_500.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"vanquishedvaliant","id":97520417184,"post_url":"http://vanquishedvaliant.tumblr.com/post/97520417184/i-had-someone-come-and-tell-me-today-that-id","slug":"i-had-someone-come-and-tell-me-today-that-id","type":"text","date":"2014-09-15 00:07:52 GMT","timestamp":1410739672,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"o6d651h3","tags":["Kaptains Log","trans","trans*","transgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZZFZzw1QqgtcW","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":9,"title":"","body":"I had someone come and tell me today that I’d inspired them and helped them realize that they were trans.

I’m so proud to know that my progress, my success (even only so far) has helped someone else discover them-self, and learn about being trans and find that it fits for them.\n\nThey thanked me personally, even though I didn’t do anything directly, but just for being there, and it made me smile so happily. Because it is thanks enough to me that even somehow, even someway, I was able to help and inspire someone. Because I know how that feels. I know exactly what it is to see someone you admire, someone you like, be able to come out as trans and be accepted, I know how helpful that can be in helping you come out yourself. Because that is exactly how it was for me.\n\nIt took someone I liked a lot and admired very much coming out for me to have the insight, the inspiration, and the courage to do so myself.

me great courage to step outside…\n\nIt’s been a transformative week.

I’m queer as they come. Promise.\n\nMoM: what do you mean your a man, I changed your diapers.\n\nMe: and you saw a vagina right? That’s genitalia mom. That does NOT define who I have to be. Just because I was born with female characteristics, Doesn’t mean mentally I am not a man. Mentally I battle this everyday. Mentally I’m still bi. Mentally I am myself and no one see it. Mentally I’m free. Physically? people see what they want to and say what they want never considering the possibility that maybe their minds are too closed to see the reality, and maybe I’m just a big gray blob on a black and white canvas. Physically, is all people acknowledge because in reality everyone judges on appearances and no one takes the time to look at what’s going on with someone mentally. I don’t cut my hair short because I’m “butch” so please stop saying that. When I wear guy clothes, its not because I’m too lazy to get prettied up. I DONT WANT TO. THATS NOT ME. Stop asking why I’m wearing my partners clothes. THEY ARE MINE. I bought them for me. These boxers are mine. It’s not that I am conforming into what “men have to wear” But because I am comfortable in these clothes. And that doesn’t mean I am a tomboy. I am not a girl who likes to do “boy” things. I’m a guy just doing what I like, and avoiding what I don’t. I’m just another person in this world who is misunderstood. I’m just one more person in this world searching for answers and discovering myself. And no mom, that doesn’t mean I am confused or mistaken, I could be, but in full honesty I doubt I am. I have found solace In discovering things about myself and coming to an understanding about all this fucked up shit Ive been going through, that I should have never had to but I did. I’ve come to accept the things I cannot change. That although it goes out of what society expects people to be or become, THIS IS WHO I AM. I do not put blame on anyone, because it is not a fault. It is my strength. Mentally mom, I am a man. I always have been even if you never saw it, or even if you don’t believe it now. Physically I am trapped in my own body. I may never fully escape this cage. I only hope you try to help me unlock all the padlocks and chains imprisoning me. your son.

through trans phases? I don't want to be like this for the rest of my life","answer":"Being trans is super amazing\n\nI don’t think people go through trans “phases”. Like even if you only ID as trans for a little while that stuff sticks with you. Like you can be a communist for a while but that will still shape how you view things for the rest of your life so it’s not just like a ‘I used to be this thing but that’s 100% over now’.\n\nPhases are what parents say you go through when they don’t like what you’re doing. We’re not moons.\n\nSo no, you don’t go through trans phases, though you can be trans for a while and realize it’s not you. But if you’re like ‘I’m hella trans and I hate it but I’m still hella trans’ it is not likely to stop. A “trans phase” doesn’t really exist in the world anyways because no one thinks trans people exist anyways so feeling trans is a trans thing or being exposed to a tooooooon of trans people. Not like being a rebellious teenager.If you wanna talk more off anon we can. \n\nHope I explained this well enough. Also broadening your vision of gender helps because you might not feel 100% a binary gender and therefore gender is hard and shitty so yeah.\n\nBeing trans is great, cis people and cissexism just sucks.

Can I get some advice with a personal issue. A couple of people in my life have wanted to talk to me about gender questioning.  They're AFAB and went through big tomboy stages where they felt jealous of boys and wished they were boys.  They talk about it as if they were passing phases but I'm not sure that's true.  Can you give me advice on helping them explore this? I'm not out to either of them (they know me as a boy) and I'm not the expert on male identity they want me to be! Thankyou x","answer":"I can see how that would be tricky! Honestly, it’s probably going to be a lot of the same things you went through, but in a different way. Lots of introspection and self examination - would they feel more comfortable using male pronouns? Do the labels “girl/woman/female” make them uncomfortable/do they not really associate with them? Something I found that helped was looking into a mirror and saying “I am a girl”, “I am a boy” and “I am not a girl or a boy” and seeing what I felt most comfortable with.\n\nGender is really complex. “Male identity” is still something I’m learning about. I’m still figuring out how to express my masculinity in ways I’m completely comfortable with. Because there isn’t just one way to be male. People associate masculinity and manliness with many different things, especially as you move into the trans community. So encourage them to educate themselves, and consider what masculinity means to them. They’re the only ones who can really know their gender, after all.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"castielwnchster","id":97505534401,"post_url":"http://castielwnchster.tumblr.com/post/97505534401/wwyd-if-you-thought-you-started-falling-4-a-girl-but","slug":"wwyd-if-you-thought-you-started-falling-4-a-girl-but","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-14 20:59:00 GMT","timestamp":1410728340,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"oyyWiiE5","tags":["replies","trans","anon"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zf1nPx1Qpo671","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"wwyd if you thought you started falling 4 a girl but then she started transitioning like to a guy ahh thoughts and feelings are cheesing crazy dude. also sweet blog, man.","answer":"i don’t think it’d change anything (in my case, anyways)\n\nin fact i hope that i might try to help out :)\n\nit might seem strange at first but keep an open mind and try to understand her/his situation - in the process, you might discover whether your feelings have strengthened, stayed the same, or perhaps gone.\n\nand yea thoughts and feelings are crazy, i feel ya OwO\n\nalso - abt my blog - thank you!! xx","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"amazoniantranswomaninthemood","id":97505469964,"post_url":"http://amazoniantranswomaninthemood.tumblr.com/post/97505469964/2-years-ago-today-i-was-in-hospital-for-self-harm","slug":"2-years-ago-today-i-was-in-hospital-for-self-harm","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-14 20:58:00 GMT","timestamp":1410728280,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"uIwKceMw","tags":["trans","mtf","transition"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZRs-Wn1QpnsOC","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"caption":"2 Years ago today i was in hospital for self harm and a half assed suicide attempt.

And the thing that I can change all the time is my hair.","photoset_layout":"2","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":422,"height":750,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_500.jpg"},{"width":338,"height":600,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_400.jpg"},{"width":225,"height":400,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":178,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cfbe9556a7a18eb471f93ddb29e4a3a9/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o1_1280.jpg"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_1280.jpg"},{"width":422,"height":750,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_500.jpg"},{"width":338,"height":600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_400.jpg"},{"width":225,"height":400,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":178,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/21d60c69e9fcc5d05ca6e0136e20488e/tumblr_nbwqos13Ez1rbxaf5o2_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"girlwhocriedsupernova","id":97500584442,"post_url":"http://girlwhocriedsupernova.tumblr.com/post/97500584442/hrt","slug":"hrt","type":"text","date":"2014-09-14 20:02:03 GMT","timestamp":1410724923,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"6WNvRKD1","tags":["gender","trans","o"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZiDNks1QpVDdw","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":5,"title":"HRT","body":"I think that there are a lot of experiences that trans women, transfeminine people, and generally AMAB trans people have in common, that we largely don’t know about because we don’t talk about them. With that in mind, therefore, I would like to share my experiences with deciding whether to start hormone replacement therapy, which I did, in hopes that it will be helpful to someone out there.\n\nFor those who don’t know, HRT is the process of replacing or supplementing the hormones naturally produced by your body, particularly the sex hormones (testosterone/androgens, estrogen, progesterone, etc.). It is used to treat both cis and trans people, and in trans people it is used to trigger a second puberty in order to relieve dysphoria.\n\nWhen I first figured out that I was trans, I didn’t think I would seek HRT or any other medical transition treatment. It’s just a body, I reasoned. It’s not me, I just happen to live inside of it, so who cares what it looks like. That is an incredibly unhealthy attitude, but one which I had necessarily developed as a child in order to protect myself from dysphoria.\n\nAs I continued processing things, however, I began to change my mind. I discovered that just as I had erected mental walls to protect myself from fully experiencing social dysphoria, I had erected even taller, thicker walls to protect myself from my body. These walls had been very effective, but I immediately started poking at them (trying to actually see myself when looking in the mirror, for instance). Bad idea.\n\nSo I figured out pretty quickly that I was interested in HRT, but I was still very apprehensive about it. It felt like a very permanent thing, and I was very scared about making a choice that I might later regret. On the other hand, I might also regret the choice to delay any longer, because I was almost 25 and bodies age differently according to what hormones are in them.\n\nAt this point, I would like to break to tell you some fun facts about sex hormones:\n\nBoth testosterone and estrogen have permanent effects during “first” puberty, such as affecting bone structure.\nTestosterone has permanent effects whenever in life it is started (facial hair, deepening voice).\nEstrogen has practically no permanent effects when started post-puberty. The only two things it does that cannot be undone by switching back to testosterone are breast development (which can be partially undone, but requires surgery to be fully undone; doesn’t even start for a month or two, isn’t noticeable for closer to sixish months) and infertility (that is, for people with testes, not for people with ovaries, obviously; declines gradually, usually gone after a year, maybe less)\nAll of this creates double-edged sword for AMAB trans folks: hormones alone cannot undo some of the things we might be dysphoric about (although I promise there are other means for dealing with the hair and the voice, it’s just more work); however trying HRT is relatively risk-free for us.\n\nMy therapist told me that many trans women who are not totally sure about HRT just try it for a little, and use that as a test to see if they are comfortable, knowing that they can stop and turn around at any time. For most cis men, HRT will likely make you feel depressed - for most dysphoric trans women it will make you feel less depressed. Obviously this is not universal, but it means you can try HRT for a little bit and see how you feel as a test for whether it might help you to be on it, which is what I did.\n\nThe first physical effects you are supposed to notice are softer skin and thinner body hair. For me, however, the first thing that happened was that I felt dramatically less anxious - like in a week or two, there was a dramatic effect. I still deal with anxiety on the regular, but the only times it goes back to what it was like before are when I forget to take my hormones! Which is pretty good affirmation for me, that I made the right decision.\n\nSo I felt pretty good, and I therefore never made the decision to stop HRT. I did have one crisis about it that lasted for a few days. I think this happened after three or four months on estrogen. One night in bed, I was lying there thinking, “I’m going to have boobs now. That’s just how it’s going to be from now on and soon enough there will be more or less no going back.” I was very dysphoric about not having breasts my whole life, like my upper torso felt this strange emptiness, but I think the permanence of it really got to me, because I had never had breasts before and now I was just going to choose to have them forevermore. Change is scary I guess. I talked it over with a couple friends and my therapist and realized that even though it was scary it was what I needed.\n\nAnyway, it’s been about 22 months since I started HRT and about 16 months since I’ve been on a full, stable dose/had my hormone levels in the medically designated “female” range. It was absolutely the right decision for me. My body is definitely not the body I would have chosen, if I could choose what my body would look like, but it is definitely a body I can live in and often be present in, none of which I could have said two years ago ago.\n\nI would encourage anyone considering this to talk to a good gender specialist about this, if you are able to (what constitutes a “good” gender therapist is a whole ‘nother story, and maybe I or someone else can make a post about that sometime - you may or may not have access to one depending on health care coverage and where you live), and maybe try it for a couple weeks to see how you feel (again, if you are able to do that - access to health care, especially what is deemed “trans” health care is very spotty almost everywhere, so you may need help trying to navigate that labyrinth as well). I am 100% always open for questions from trans or questioning people about this topic.\n\nGo in peace and be well and remember to love yourselves as much as you can manage, and if you can’t manage, find some friends to do it for you.\n\nReblogs are encouraged on this post if you think it will help your followers.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"helloiammaggie","id":97500400192,"post_url":"http://helloiammaggie.tumblr.com/post/97500400192/lazy-sunday-selfies","slug":"lazy-sunday-selfies","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-14 20:00:04 GMT","timestamp":1410724804,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"s03BzYH6","tags":["selfie","cute","redhead","mtf","trans","transgirl","transgender","girl","picture","photo"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z2ylWt1QpUWf0","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":16,"caption":"lazy sunday selfies.","photoset_layout":"11","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":480,"height":640,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/48dd0d573e0dc4f541b30a417d9924a1/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno2_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/48dd0d573e0dc4f541b30a417d9924a1/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno2_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/48dd0d573e0dc4f541b30a417d9924a1/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/48dd0d573e0dc4f541b30a417d9924a1/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/48dd0d573e0dc4f541b30a417d9924a1/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":480,"height":640,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/48dd0d573e0dc4f541b30a417d9924a1/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno2_500.jpg"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":480,"height":640,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2bf683953368eb3f5c492808702a23e6/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2bf683953368eb3f5c492808702a23e6/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2bf683953368eb3f5c492808702a23e6/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2bf683953368eb3f5c492808702a23e6/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2bf683953368eb3f5c492808702a23e6/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":480,"height":640,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2bf683953368eb3f5c492808702a23e6/tumblr_nbwq84ZhAr1s0iwtno1_500.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"worldiary","id":97500040152,"post_url":"http://worldiary.tumblr.com/post/97500040152/the-trans-everything-ceo","slug":"the-trans-everything-ceo","type":"link","date":"2014-09-14 19:55:46 GMT","timestamp":1410724546,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"sqS4LtT0","tags":["trans","trans*","ceo","to read","business"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zceunv1QpT8lO","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"title":"The Trans-Everything CEO","url":"http://nymag.com/news/features/martine-rothblatt-transgender-ceo/","link_image":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_nbwq0yND4z1rr82y2_og.jpg","description":"Futurist, pharma tycoon, satellite entrepreneur, philosopher.

The leader, by proxy as it is the name of the show as well the Moon apparently is the most powerful ‘planet’ in our solar system. She is a bi-polar binge eater who is addicted to video games. She also is dating a pedophile.\n\nSailor Mercury: 14 years old. The smart one. Her attacks include throwing dish soap bubbles as well water balloons and a thick misty gas cloud at enemies. Her weapon is a tablet with GPS capabilities. \n\nSailor Mars: 14 years old. The bitchy one. She is sometimes psychic (like Madame Cleo) and has a pervy Grandpa. She worships the devil and shoots flaming fortune cookie fortunes at her opponents.\n\nSailor Jupiter: 14 years old. The tall one. Her parents are dead so she has her own apartment and therefore is also the cool one. She also cooks a lot and indulges Sailor Moon’s eating disorder. Her powers are all over the place, sometimes lighting, sometimes flowers and sometimes coconuts.\n\nSailor Venus: 14 years old. The one whose name rhymes with penis. She is the first Sailor Scout found. Her hobbies include identity theft, as she likes to imitate princesses as well play volleyball. Her dream is to become the first blonde Japanese Karaoke-based pop star. Her weapon of choice is anal-beads (sorry, a ‘love-me’ chain).\n\nSailor Chibi-Moon: 8 years old. The pink one. She likes to sexually fantasize over a younger version of her father. She is exactly like Sailor Moon, except much younger, weaker and whinier. Her powers include a pink power rod that shoots sugary juice. Everything she owns and wears is pink except for her red demon eyes.\n\nSailor Uranus: 17 years old. The deceiving one. She is a lesbian who likes to dress like a boy to lure in much younger girls. Despite her name her powers actually come from above and not below. Her weapon is a jeweled sword that she likes to keeps inside herself for safekeeping.\n\nSailor Neptune: 17 years old. The green one. Her natural hair colour is aqua and one can only assume the carpet matches the drapes. Her powers are stemmed from water, and unlike Sailor Mercury, she can drown a bitch. She is also a lesbian and lover (or cousin depending on the translation) of Sailor Uranus.\n\nSailor Pluto: 21 years old. The multicultural one. She is the only non-white Sailor. She is Italian, black or some kind of Spanish. Her weapon is a big ass-key, which is used to open all of our hearts. She spent most of her life watching a big door to the future and was charged to kill anyone who touches it. She fails several times.\n\nSailor Saturn: 12 years old. The Goth one. This kid is obsessed with wearing black and suffers from social anxiety, depression and heart palpitations, basically a hypochondriac. She is the most dangerous as her powers can destroy planets, and carries a big ass stick of doom. She is one badass mother you don’t want to mess with.\n\nSailor Star-Fighter: 17 years old. An MTF transgender who is a football star and the lead singer in a boy band. As a boy they are in love with Sailor Moon, as a girl they have the longest rat-tail ever and like to wear bondage gear.\n\nSailor Star-Healer: 17 years old. An MTF transgender who as a boy is a bitchy gay guy and as a girl is a bitchy gay guy. Their powers include being the most tanned albino ever and reading a queen down.\n\nSailor Star-Maker: 17 years old. An MTF transgender whose powers literally come from their uterus. As a boy they are the most intellectual of the three starlights, as a girl they are the butchest of the three.\n\nTuxedo Mask: 19 years old. A college student and a pedophile that loves Sailor Moon, wearing tuxedos and wearing marks. Its obvious he owns shares in floral companies as he is constantly throwing roses at women. He is also famed for trying to bring castanets as a backing soundtrack back into fashion.\n\nSailor Galaxia: (age unknown). Basically the Cher of the Sailor Scouts. The bitch loves gold, bracelets and turning people into diamond shape crystals and keeping them in her collection. She is stronger than everyone and she will be the first to let you know it and let you have it hunty.\n\nThere you have it, the world of Sailor Moon summed up for a new generation. By golly its great to see the wonderment of stories summed up for the kids.","image_permalink":"http://marcmyworks.tumblr.com/image/97498029318","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":800,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":313,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":250,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":156,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":63,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":800,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cf51e9c40d09986a5436a2b931276c4a/tumblr_nbwoxfpVe71rywwu3o1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"lgbtq-youthsouth-project","id":97497934566,"post_url":"http://lgbtq-youthsouth-project.tumblr.com/post/97497934566/study-says-tn-among-states-where-transgender-voters","slug":"study-says-tn-among-states-where-transgender-voters","type":"link","date":"2014-09-14 19:30:58 GMT","timestamp":1410723058,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"CHrd0kT1","tags":["southern","south","lgbt","trans","transsexual","transgender","tennessee","alabama","mississippi"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZbNRjm1QpL6hc","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Study says TN among states where transgender voters face barriers at polls","url":"http://knoxblogs.com/humphreyhill/2014/09/14/study-says-tn-among-states-transgender-voters-face-barriers-polls/","description":"Tennessee makes a list of 10 states where, according to a Williams Institute study, transgender voters are “vulnerable to significant barriers at the polls and possibly disenfranchisement this November,” according to MSNBC.

I mean, who wants to identify with a medical condition, right? Who would willingly embrace a label that brings with it such fear and such loathing? […] Because of it I shook with fear under barrages of slurs and threats hurled at me by strangers on the street. I shuddered in pain under needles and scalpels as my body was remade to affirm the image of myself that was imprinted on my mind.\n\n  Somewhere along the journey, something changed: Despite all of the pain and travail, I grew not only to accept my journey, but to treasure it. Today I am accepted by the world without question as the woman I am and have indeed always been and I no longer have to wear a maligned and misunderstood medical condition as my identity. And yet today I choose to.\n\n Today I say it with pride: I am transgender. And with no small amount of gratitude either. Because today I see it as one of the greatest gifts that I have ever received. I am thankful that I am transgender because being trans has shown me that there were other perspectives, other ways of viewing and experiencing the World that were just as valid as my own, maybe even more so.\n\nAllyson Robinson was recently ordained a Baptist

that\n\nand even the idea of using “agender” as a descriptor sometimes really appeals to me because sometimes I don’t feel like either but not in a way that makes me feel “in-between” but rather as if I’m really in a state of being WITHOUT any one gender\n\nugh this is complicated and I really would appreciate anybody’s input","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sharks-and-cigs","id":97492565598,"post_url":"http://sharks-and-cigs.tumblr.com/post/97492565598/the-biggest-faggot-of-them-all","slug":"the-biggest-faggot-of-them-all","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-14

(Although there is some penis envy but mostly cos you can play WAY more with it. Like even have fun while peeing..!) If someone asked what gender I feel like inside \"neither\" would probably be most accurate, but i usually feel more masculine/not girl when around other girls. Genderneutral sounds right to me cos spirit isn't gender but can you explain the difference between that and genderfluid?","answer":"I do love questions!\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the definitions of gender aren’t all-inclusive things set in stone. There’s no one right way to be any gender (or lack of gender).\n\nBut I am comfortable speaking in generalities. In general, genderfluid people are more than one gender, and that gender changes. It can change from day to day, or throughout the day, or over the course of a longer period of time. For example, I’m genderfluid. Sometimes I’m a girl, sometimes demiboy, sometimes androgyne, sometimes agender. Some people shift between male and female, or female and agender, or any other combination of genders. Genderfluid people may also be more than one gender at any given time, but the “fluid” part suggests that there are changes involved over time.\n\nFrom what I have seen, people who are gender neutral do not all agree on what that means as a gender identity. Some say it is a lack of gender. Some don’t really feel it’s a gender identity, but a gender presentation: a way to look and act that doesn’t identify you as any specific gender. Maybe some folks who identify as gender neutral can chime in with their experiences? \n\nA couple of things to keep in mind when you’re talking about gender: if you’re not a girl then you don’t have a girl’s body. There are men and non-binary people who have vaginas, breasts, etc. If you want to specify what gender the doctors and your parents picked for you, you can say you were assigned female at birth (AFAB) or designated female at birth (DFAB). \n\nAnother word that you may find helpful is trans masculine. Trans masculine people are AFAB folks who identify as at least somewhat masculine.\n\nAs you share experiences with being trans, people are going to bring up dysphoria. In the most general terms, dysphoria is simply knowing that you’re a different gender than you were assigned at birth. But it can also be used to talk more specifically about things like “penis envy.” If you feel you would be happier with a penis and/or you experience distress because you don’t have one, then that can be described as sex dyshporia. Being uncomfortable with being identified as female by other people (like when they use the wrong pronouns for you) is often called social dysphoria. (ps, be aware that the concept of “penis envy” is rooted in misogyny).\n\nIgnore anyone who tells you that dyshporia is required to be trans, because they don’t understand what dyshpria actually is, and they distort the meaning of it in order to exclude people they don’t like.\n\nA final note, to hopefully ward off the kind of people who make a fuss about this: there are folks out there who will tell you that gender neutral is not a gender identity, that it just refers to presentation. But they’re wrong. There are people who identify as gender neutral, and there’s nothing wrong with that. If it is right for you, that’s what’s important.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"ineffablyfebruary","id":97488187337,"post_url":"http://ineffablyfebruary.tumblr.com/post/97488187337/morning","slug":"morning","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-14 17:33:33 GMT","timestamp":1410716013,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"FRrqtKRt","tags":["trans","hrt","dmab","selfie"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZlkOdt1Qolw-9","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"caption":"morning","image_permalink":"http://ineffablyfebruary.tumblr.com/image/97488187337","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/7fe0ed0a0c417d96f7a734b0767eeb8b/tumblr_nbwjfxxqjb1rmh8jqo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"littlestsuspect","id":97487903227,"post_url":"http://littlestsuspect.tumblr.com/post/97487903227/ewww","slug":"ewww","type":"text","date":"2014-09-14 17:30:07 GMT","timestamp":1410715807,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"t0478vge","tags":["not my feminism","feminism","trans","yuck"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZAHgKt1Qokrdx","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"title":"Ewww..","body":"Ugh, I stumbled into a nest of gross TERF blogs because someone reblogged one of my posts…\n\nSo pissed and anxious now.\n\nIf you don’t support the existence and happiness of trans and gender nonconforming people, don’t fucking reblog my shit.

Ford \n\nWhen she was 13 years old, Andreja Pejić googled the word “transitioning.” Puberty was approaching, and she was loathe to see her body grow into something even further away from what she wanted to see in the mirror. Google helped her find the answers she needed. “I discovered it was a national community, and there were doctors, and medical help. It wasn’t something ‘freaky’ or ‘bizarre’; there was a system.” She describes herself as a “geeky boy” eager to become physically female.\n\nThe visual of a “geeky boy” is hard to reconcile with the ethereal supermodel we see draped in couture fashions today. Known for her ability to conquer the runway dressed as a man or woman, androgyny has been her schtick since Andreja was known as Andrej. In 2011, New York magazine named Pejić “The Prettiest Boy in the World,” a title Pejić wasn’t altogether comfortable with. “The plan was to enjoy modeling, then get out, and transition. The more and more known I became, the harder that goal was. The whole world already knew me.”\n\nWell before the world knew her name, Pejić lived with her family in a Serbian refugee camp. Despite their living conditions, she describes her childhood as carefree. “I remember playing in the street a lot. I adored South American soap operas and pretending to speak Spanish. I had a happy childhood, but not a lot of material things.” Pejić’s mother, Jadranka Savić, had been formally educated as a lawyer, but took a series of a rural jobs to support her children, Andreja, and her brother Igor. Pejić’s parents were divorced, and even with the help of her own mother, Jadranka found it difficult to provide for her family.\n\n“I think my mom and grandma struggled a lot to provide for us. There were almost no jobs. We could barely afford honey.”\n\nOnce the family immigrated to Australia, they found slightly less financial hardship, but now had to deal with assimilating. At 9 years old, Pejić did not blend into her new surroundings seamlessly. “I was a very shy child. I was learning how to navigate a different world in several ways: a whole new language, a whole new culture. It was very different from European culture. Even things as simple as asking your grandmother to pack you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, instead of a lasagna. I did that just so I could fit in with the other Australian kids.”\n\nWhat Pejić found hardest to assimilate to in her new surrounding wasn’t the culinary fare, but gendered expectations she was reluctant to take on. “I could no longer get away with playing with dolls. I had to integrate into a boy. In order to not be bullied, and not be seen as weird, and not be an outsider. I learned how to behave like a boy and suppress my natural characteristics, the way I walked and the way I talked. It was just about getting through the day without too much trouble. It wasn’t the best time in my life.”\n\nPejić believes she survived this particular time in her life due to a rich fantasy life inside her own head. “I was saved by my imagination. I would imagine what it would be like to go shopping with my mother as a girl. Some would say these were really mundane things, but I would dream about what life would be like as a girl, and it made me very happy.”\n\nPejić’s decision to transition was not as sudden as it seemed. She’s been transitioning since she was 13 years old. “I ordered medication online, saw doctors, and I came out to my mom. Once I had the support of my family, I had more confidence. Then, I started going to a liberal high school.” It was at University High that Pejić first embraced an androgynous identity. “Androgyny became a way of expressing my femininity, being pretty, and wearing girly clothing or unisex clothing. I didn’t have to explain things about gender identity, sexuality, or genetics. It didn’t have to go that deep and I felt like my peers wouldn’t understand what it means to be trans.”\n\nStill, it was her androgynous look that first got her noticed in the fashion industry, and ultimately catapulted her into a career as one of the most sought-after high fashion models, something Pejić says she never saw coming. “I didn’t expect to become famous. I didn’t expect to have the career that I have. I became kind of a poster child for androgyny. In the beginning I wasn’t ready to talk about wanting to transition or my internal feelings about gender dysmorphia, because it’s one thing to come out to your mom; it’s another to come out to the public.”\n\nPejić notes the intensely image-conscious fashion community as just one of the reasons she didn’t initially come out as trans. Despite her involvement in the community, few knew about her desire to transition. “Some people were very supportive and some people thought I would lose something, that I would no longer be special. I’m still the same person with the same ideas. But I had to do it for myself. I couldn’t worry about doing it for anyone else.” So how did she get to the point where she felt safe to tell the world she was a woman, and have the surgery she’d wanted since she was 13? “At the beginning of last year, I sat myself down and stared in the mirror and said, ‘Do you want to spend the rest of your life wondering what it would be like to feel completely comfortable in your own body?’”\n\nPejić felt she was at a place where she had a lot to lose if her industry would not accept her as a trans woman. While recognizing this could be true, Pejić decided she didn’t care. “You can’t let your career decide anymore when you’re going to do this. If I didn’t do it then, I wouldn’t have done it. I would have put it off for way too long, and I would be miserable. There was a need. A constant internal need. It was always there.”\n\nNearly 10 years after searching Google for a way out of her body, Pejić decided to have sexual reassignment surgery. She slowly let her close friends know what she was planning to do and received their loving support. One friend, filmmaker Eric Miclette, went even further than support and immediately encouraged Pejić to film the process of her transitioning. “We’ve worked on small projects before, and when I said, ‘I’m going in for SRS in a few weeks,’ he said, ‘You need to get some footage. You have one chance and you need to tell your story.’”\n\nAt first, Pejić was reluctant. “I can’t say that I wanted to capture that or that having a camera around was the way I dreamt of it being. It was a very personal thing and I wanted it to keep it that way. I’m a very private person, and yes, very shy. It wasn’t my dream to have a camera there. But he really changed my mind about that. He asked me to think about the people who’ve had to hide their whole lives and who will find inspiration because you decided to go public with this.” They decided to collaborate on an intimate documentary, with Pejić insisting she didn’t want a lot of cameras involved, just Miclette.\n\nFor his own part, Miclette asked for access into the model’s life, past and present, though neither of them wanted the documentary to be a “vanity project.” In their commitment to this shared goal, Pejić is in no way involved in the film except as its focus. “I remain a subject of the documentary. I’m not a producer or a director. I think in order to create a critical work, an objective work, I needed to be a subject with no creative influence. I had to show the true me, and allow [Miclette] into my life completely, and not worry about looking good all the time or saying the right thing. I had to let go of all of that.”\n\nFor now, Andrej(a) is still in production with a Kickstarter campaign that has already raised over $25,000 to see it come to fruition as a distributable film. Since the launch of the campaign, Pejić has been most excited to see messages and mail from the people she believes need to see this film most. “We’ve been getting all kinds of incredible messages, many of them from parents. I think parents are a big target for this because I was lucky to have a family, and to have their support. Too many kids in the LGBT community are being abandoned. It’s not right. Everyone should have their parents’ support. I hope this film brings parents understanding.”\nPejić says that while her mother was supportive, she was also concerned about the quality of life her child could expect to lead as a trans woman, something her daughter worried about as well. Ultimately, it was the desire for a life lived most authentically that gave Pejić the confidence she needed to “feel comfortable in her own skin.” That happiness is something she thinks all parents want for their children, and something more trans folks can have access to with more understanding. She said, “Transitioning isn’t just physical, it’s also social. It’s not enough to just change your looks and your body; you also have a need to be accepted by society and the people around you in the gender role that you feel you are. I definitely feel like I’m more comfortable. I feel like I can live the life of being a girl I’ve always wanted.”\n\nFrom BuzzFeed","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"shemail-delivery","id":97477373503,"post_url":"http://shemail-delivery.tumblr.com/post/97477373503/um-so-i-ordered-a-m-sized-binder-and-it-doesnt-do","slug":"um-so-i-ordered-a-m-sized-binder-and-it-doesnt-do","type":"text","date":"2014-09-14 15:15:00 GMT","timestamp":1410707700,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"LJQpEhIS","tags":["underworks","binder","ftm","trans","chest binder"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z_D5yp1Qo6gu-","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"title":"Um so I ordered a M sized binder and it doesn't do shit??","body":"I figured since I’m a 36-38 C/D (sometimes) that M would be the correct size, well it didn’t do shit and I’m pretty upset.

Dresses and makeup are for every gender, it really sucks that a lot of people don’t think that, especially when it’s people close to you like your family! Clothes do not define gender, listener, not at all! Please believe me when I say that you are a real boy. \n\nWhat your mother said was absolutely wrong, gender is an issue everyone should explore at some point in their life, it’s no different to becoming ‘obsessed’ with eating or breathing. Feeling comfortable with yourself is a necessity. \n\nKeep faith in yourself Listener, continue to ask your family to respect your pronouns and gender and keep strong in the knowledge that you are as much of a boy as you feel, no matter what anyone says. Maybe you could try and explain to your family how clothes do not define gender or say that girls aren’t real girls unless they wear dresses all the time. Comparisons are always good, sometimes it is necessary to turn a situation on it’s head so people can see how they’re wrong.\n\nEither, any and other way, I hope everything goes well for you listener, and even if it doesn’t, you will not be with your family forever. Soon you will be with lizards instead.

Lamar Kick Off GenderFluid Spreading Awareness (And Shade)","url":"http://www.nextmagazine.com/content/laverne-cox-and-brother-m-lamar-kick-genderfluid-spreading-awareness-and-shade","description":"Two aesthetically opposite worlds converged on the stage of the Baruch Performing Arts Center on Tuesday night during a conversation between Orange is the New Black star Laverne Cox and her identical twin brother, artist M. Lamar. “This just proves you can be identical twins, grow up in the same household, and be different,” said Cox, whose blonde hair and white dress was in sharp contrast to Lamar’s black hair and punk inspired ensemble. \n\nThroughout the night, Lamar would make jokes about his sister’s appearance, relating it too Beyoncé in a sarcastic way. “So this is how it’s going to be?” said Cox. “You don’t understand. My brother loves to throw shade.”\n\nThe conversation between Cox and Lamar was the kickoff event of Baruch College’s weeklong GenderFluid festival. Running through Sept. 13, this week of binary-challenging performances and events is organized by Spin Cycle NYC. It celebrates trans and genderfluid artists and features the legendary gender outlaw Kate Bornstein, Holly Woodlawn and more. When Cox and Lamar took to the stage, Lamar quipped a bit about literal “gender fluids” such as the many fluids men and women could secrete.\n\nCox took a slightly more serious approach to introducing the topic after Lamar talked about how people don’t see him in the light of stereotypical black masculinity. “Gender isn’t something anyone should decide for you,” said Cox. “We need to live in and out of our own terms of gender.”\n\nThe evening often played out in this sort of debate. Lamar, for instance, was more critical of mainstream corporate culture during the discussion, while Cox advocated for the other side. Lamar even went so far as to criticize his sister’s claim to fame, Orange is the New Black, saying he is not interested in black roles written by white people.\n\n“My job is not to judge the material,” said Cox. She went on to say that her main efforts are put towards bringing humanity and her personal interpretation to all her work. She continued, saying she has really enjoyed everything that OITNB has done for women.\n\nLamar, further fueling apropos discussion with his sister, called into question her potential tokenism, feeling that Hollywood may assume it has fulfilled its black, trans woman quota.\n\nCox responded with a quote by Sidney Poitier, who himself felt that black people didn’t overcome with his winning the Oscar because he was the only one. She feels like it’s her job, while she has this time in the spotlight, to push other trans women forward and to continue to discuss the death rates and mistreatment of trans women of color, which, statistically, is more than other members of the LBGT community.\n\nLamar applauded his sister’s efforts.\n\nThings got a bit emotional for Cox when the two began to talk about their upbringing. Lamar hasn’t spoken to his mother in 15 years. Though the two had different opinions about their alleged familial trauma, Cox articulated that some topics are hard to discuss, but there is such a need to push through, without feeling judged, in order to create safer spaces for people to talk through their trauma.

your size depends both on strap length and cup size. like a 34B and a 32C have the same cup volume but different strap lengths. and a 32D has the same cup volume as a 34C, but the smaller number means smaller strap lengths, so they fit differently. if you have a bigger cup volume, you’ll have to go bigger with the binder size\n\ni was a 34C before i started T and afterwards my size actually reduced a little bit, which was nice but ofc i had surgery anyways cause i still had significant breast tissue. \n\nmy preferred type of binder is velcro short ones, because they bind well but also you can loosen / tighten them easily. i used these two different kinds for most of my binding needs, and they worked great. \n\nwhen binding, it’s important that you find a binder that fits you well, and that doesnt impair your breathing. remember that you shouldnt wear it for extended periods of time, and if you have to wear it continuously, go into a bathroom or something to take like 5 minute binderless breaks every once in a while. binding can be dangerous. also, never sleep with your binder on!!!\n\nu could bruise or break your ribs or develop breathing problems if you bind too tight or for too long. so please be careful. \n\nlesloveboat is my favourite site for trans related stuff cause they have so many options in terms of binders, including binding swimwear. and they also have lots of resources for packing and scar treatment after surgery. basically theyve got it all!

saw a couple of friends that we hang out with a handful of times per month anymore, one of whom is our former roommate (and also my bro/best friend type person). She says that my voice is definitely deeper, there’s some facial changes, and the same shoulder/neck thing that Kari has pointed out =). She is pretty excited for me for everything, and while I fail at knowing how to take it, it’s nice.\n\nMy only real issue emotionally arose tonight, when my singing voice was mentioned. It prompted me to look some things up, and I am extremely nervous that I may never sing well again. I’ve read research stating that low dose testosterone over time is best if you wish to maintain a singing voice that isn’t trashed, and I am already on a higher dosage than that allows for (.5cc weekly, which will increase somehow when I go in on Thursday this week). It’ll probably just take time and being over puberty 2.0 before I’m good enough to go out for karaoke again, but damn. That was my largest hesitation with transitioning for a long time, and I’ve probably already ruined it.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"whowebecomefilm","id":97450216267,"post_url":"http://whowebecomefilm.tumblr.com/post/97450216267/the-film-is-about-building-a-trans-family","slug":"the-film-is-about-building-a-trans-family","type":"video","date":"2014-09-14 05:47:00 GMT","timestamp":1410673620,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"WrYtvqVE","tags":["trans","trans*","transgender","ftm","ftm transgender","ftm problems","ftm transition","ftm transman","mtf","mtf trans","mtf problems","mtf timeline","lgbt","lgtb rights","transgender rights","transgender resources","trans resources","trans representation","trans related","trans rights","trans people","trans pride","trans parenting","trans parents","trans stuff","trans support","trans activism","trans art","trans ally","trans students"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZozXXm1QmV4jB","followed":false,"post_author":"adamgperez","highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"caption":"The film is about building a trans family, focusing on a makeshift family bonded by the search for community.

This week, the entertainer — who identifies as both female and male — became the first two-spirit person to perform at the Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards.\n\nICEIS Rain is also Massey Whiteknife, a 35-year-old member of the Mikisew Cree First Nation, who identifies as as a man sometimes and as Rain, a woman, at other times. Being two-spirit, he explains to CBC, means “you have accepted both your masculinity and femininity and you embrace both your spirits.”\n\n“Two-spirit\" is an identification used by some First Nations people to describe their nonbinary gender identity. Some consider it most closely synonymous with the Western concept of \"bi-gender\" people and include it in the \"transgender umbrella\" of identifiers. Other sources, such as the CBC report below, equate \"being two-spirited\" with being \"gay.\" The term, however, is not exactly equivalent to either \"transgender\" and/or \"gay.\"\n\nFor Whiteknife, living his two-spirit identity means that, by day, he is a gay male business owner in the sub-arctic Alberta oil sands. At night, she is ICEIS Rain, a female karaoke performer. Whiteknife and Rain share the same body, he explained to CBC, but each has their own passions and pursuits.\n\nAs Rain, she gained notoriety last year as a featured performer in the documentary Oil Sands Karaoke, and is working on a singing career. As Whiteknife, he gained accolades as a business tycoon, building up several oil sands-based businesses very quickly into a multi-million dollar operation.\n\nWhiteknife says Rain, as his formidable, “queen”-like second spirit, helped him overcome childhood sexual abuse, bullying, and gang rape to become highly admired in both his careers as a businessman and as an entertainer.\n\nRain, who is known for her anti-bullying anthem, “The Queen,” has now been nominated for two Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards. Whiteknife tells CBC he is humbled by the attention and to be the first two-spirit person to take the award ceremony’s performance stage.\n\n\"I don’t even have the words to express the emotions,\" he added. \"I’m overwhelmed, I’m honored.\"","can_reply":false}]

my appointment with my endocrinologist, I’ve been letting the fact that I will be starting testosterone sink in. Like, this is what I’ve been waiting for, and then I’m like damn…this is it. I’m going to start T and I haven’t told more than three people in my family that i’m trans and plan on transitioning. \n\nI don’t know how fast changes will happen and I’m sort of glad that I’m in a position where changes will speak for themselves if I don’t hurry up and disclose to family. \n\nI suppose I’ve just been avoiding telling my mother because our relationship is so dysfunctional. I am overly concerned about her thoughts, feelings and opinions, and she couldn’t give a flying fuck about mine. Caring too much is something that I’m unlearning with her, I just don’t know what to say or how to say it. \n\nI figure since I’ve told my dad, and will be telling my mom, they can take the liberty of informing their respective sides of the family. I feel like i don’t owe anyone a conversation about my life and choices to improve my life. So I guess they will just have to deal with hearing it through the grapevine as I hear news of their lives in the same manner. \n\nUnfortunately, I don’t have the greatest relationships with my siblings, not because we don’t love and respect each other, but because of the whole broken home, separation stuff that displaced all of us. I hope they understand and still love me when it’s said and done. \n\nFor the first time in my life, seriously, first time ever, I’m considering myself before anyone else, and as foreign as it is for me, it feels right.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"zazzle-poetry","id":97426180828,"post_url":"http://zazzlepoetry.co.vu/post/97426180828/buy-here","slug":"buy-here","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-14 00:00:58 GMT","timestamp":1410652858,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"NrTv1tEx","tags":["trans","lgbt","lgbtqia","mogai","nonbinary","salem","twitter shirts"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZHcW9v1Ql3OhS","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":71,"caption":"buy here","link_url":"http://www.zazzle.com/the_opposite_gender_looks_into_the_camera-235309576672704898?rf=238381944363965063","image_permalink":"http://zazzlepoetry.co.vu/image/97426180828","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":450,"height":508,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2096ba7985b84cdd5432416fbfc80bf0/tumblr_nbmi6nf3Nk1rxvkrmo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":452,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2096ba7985b84cdd5432416fbfc80bf0/tumblr_nbmi6nf3Nk1rxvkrmo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":282,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2096ba7985b84cdd5432416fbfc80bf0/tumblr_nbmi6nf3Nk1rxvkrmo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":113,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2096ba7985b84cdd5432416fbfc80bf0/tumblr_nbmi6nf3Nk1rxvkrmo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2096ba7985b84cdd5432416fbfc80bf0/tumblr_nbmi6nf3Nk1rxvkrmo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":450,"height":508,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2096ba7985b84cdd5432416fbfc80bf0/tumblr_nbmi6nf3Nk1rxvkrmo1_500.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"korolax","id":97425787404,"post_url":"http://korolax.tumblr.com/post/97425787404/i-need-help-with-a-psychology-project","slug":"i-need-help-with-a-psychology-project","type":"text","date":"2014-09-13 23:55:20 GMT","timestamp":1410652520,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"9AjTPCka","tags":["trans","trans*","transpeople","transgender","lgbtq"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zorqoq1Ql1ueC","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":8,"title":"I Need Help With A Psychology Project","body":"Hello!

viewing the whole “babytrans will understand when they’re oldertrans” as itself an extremely immature train of thought.\n\nlike, this all makes me think of the important themes in Nevada, Imogen Binnie’s novel. like, maria carrying on with this idea in her rambling to james that “oh, well, yeah, he doesn’t wanna hear this but that’s just because he’s not ready.” how are you going to base

Even like bathing and looking at lower body parts I was sure they were not female parts, that doctors and parents were just mistaken.\n\n It’s so weird to think about, i mean, once puberty hit it was like, oh, i have those inside bits.

So i became hugely shy and withdrawn. \n\nEven if no one reads this it was useful to write. and read back.\n\ntldr; My gender is something i cannot control and has always felt as real as medical proof of maleness, despite the physical evidence.\n\nidk, someone talk to me about this?","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"lepsog","id":97417719274,"post_url":"http://lepsog.tumblr.com/post/97417719274","slug":"","type":"link","date":"2014-09-13 22:03:29 GMT","timestamp":1410645809,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"OxQX6Zqj","tags":["trans","transsexual","top surgery","hotbaradadmar","my bff","fundly"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZaTThr1QkZ6tg","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","url":"https://fundly.com/m2/marcus-transition-surgery","description":"Help my friend Marcus get top surgery.

venue for it? idk, maybe i’m getting defensive.\n\npoint is: i typed out a long response that i don’t wanna post on fb for a few reasons\n\nin that public forum i could be easily interpolated as a cis man\ni, wrongly, i admit, will take (and have already taken) the indictments as indictments on my humanity, trans or otherwise, and while i can deal w that on tumblr or okcupid, i cannot on the public presentation and ubiquitous communication tool that facebook is for me. \nmy opinions are worth shite and, even if they are sometimes good, they are expressed in a real didactic way bc of a lot of abuse having-to-explain-every-detail-to-have-love-not-withheld-for-minor-offenses shit (no excuse tho, learning to compress things all the time), so ppl don’t wanna listen bc i am being a total

of the, like, perfect tracks (guinness, anarchist, anarcho punx, danger, walking), i find reinventing axl rose to be pretty boring, exemplifying the folk punk tropes of screeching voice equals earnestness/profundity, but, i mean, that disagreement is all about taste and there’s no accounting for that. that said, like, searching for a former clarity is perfect af. i also think “i was a teenage anarchist” to be a pretty great song and, taking into account interviews w/ LJG at the time, not as big of a disavowal or ideological shift as a lot of people took it to be. when i saw the song title when i was 18, i was pissed too, but listening to it years later, it moved me and, if the whole initial feeling of betrayal was based on thinking of listening to the music as a conversation of sorts, letting her speak thru those interviews and not just the tune made the it view it with more complexity. not to say that this could account for everything she could have to say, or that she is/was completely “right” or whatever, it just helped me consider it as not such a direct slap in the face or not such ideological shift as previously thought.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"savannahs-world","id":97415743857,"post_url":"http://savannahs-world.tumblr.com/post/97415743857/also-went-from-this-to-this-on-a-little-under-3","slug":"also-went-from-this-to-this-on-a-little-under-3","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-13

I’m on an experiement kick, trying some new things to see how they work. That patch on my lip? Yeah, I didn’t grow that, I ordered it off of a site called ActOne. Now, You can probably tell it’s not exactly home grown, but I garuntee you from a distance you wouldn’t think twice. I plan to have a friend trim it down for me so it looks a little less “Soul” and a little more “Style” but yes, I in fact do plan to grow one of these snazzy accessories once I am officially on Testosterone (Lord willing). If you’re feeling dysphoric, it’s not actually a bad buy, and it’s made with real human hair. I’m holding it on my face just for these pictures with Hair gel (Because I accidentally shipped the facial adhesive to my mum (woops)) but once it comes in I will review how well it sticks (along with how it looks trimmed) Which brings me to the two bottles of vitamins I’m holding in the second picture. Beardilizer and MaxGenics. \n\nBeardilizer is a natural hair complex designed to help men grow a stronger, fuller, healthier beard. MaxGenics is a natural testosterone booster and estrogen blocker. I’m trying the two together to see if I notice and suddle changes. I just started them yesterday but I will keep all of you updated so as to save you some money on buying a product that doesn’t do squat diddly for you. \n\nFeel free to message me if you have any more questions for me personally or about these three products, or suggestions on pricing, websites, passing, etc. \n\nAlso, you all might be interested to know I found an adhereable STP/Packer prosthetic which will be coming out this fall. I plan to buy it as soon as it comes out (Pricing is still unknown) but for those of you who might be interested i’ll put the link here","photoset_layout":"11","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":720,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":281,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":225,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":141,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":56,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":720,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2d9f155f341c8951d90ffddd6da748be/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo1_1280.jpg"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":720,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":281,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":225,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":141,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":56,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":720,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/b1430a77652c41bcf2e40c31ad6f123b/tumblr_nbuzwo2rIZ1tgyvfdo2_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"officiallyblake","id":97415293934,"post_url":"http://officiallyblake.tumblr.com/post/97415293934/why-do-i-have-to-have-a-therapists-approval-to","slug":"why-do-i-have-to-have-a-therapists-approval-to","type":"text","date":"2014-09-13 21:31:56 GMT","timestamp":1410643916,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"iwUSspqd","tags":["trans","transgender","transguy","transman","ftm","ftm transgender","top surgery","lgbt","lgbtq"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZjTYim1QkPslk","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":125,"title":"","body":"why do I have to have a therapist’s approval to get top surgery, yet if someone wants to get a boob job all they need is the money? it’s my body, why do I not have complete control over it?","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"officiallyblake","id":97414840504,"post_url":"http://officiallyblake.tumblr.com/post/97414840504/ollie-renee-schminkey-boobs-cupsi-2014-youtube","slug":"ollie-renee-schminkey-boobs-cupsi-2014-youtube","type":"link","date":"2014-09-13 21:26:09 GMT","timestamp":1410643569,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"vM5hBivV","tags":["spoken word","poetry","poem","button poetry","trans","transgender","ftm","mtf","ftm transgender","mtf transgender","transguy","transgirl","transman","transwoman","lgbt","lgbtq","genderqueer","genderfluid","agender","bigender","afab","amab"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZjTYim1QkO82u","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":11,"title":"Ollie Renee Schminkey - \"Boobs\" (CUPSI 2014) - YouTube","url":"http://youtu.be/Pi7Vss4GYks","description":"this is one of the best spoken word poems I’ve heard by far.

I’m sick of the people on tumblr going on about bullshit, putting people down and calling it social justice, not to mention pretending what they are not. \n\nI’ve gotten call cis scum here on this site because I am a white hetero cis female and my existence alone is “oppressive”, but you know who really is oppressive? You, the people who whine about this kind of bullshit and make themselves a victim. That includes the tumblr feminists, trans community, culture aproprists and the list goes on. For example I do think of myself as a feminist and have feminist views. Why I would never be a part of the tumblr feminists? Because blogging about hating men and making yourself the victim 24/7 isn’t feminism. It’s stupidity!\n\nAlso the trans community is not much better than the feminists. I really don’t care if you are trans, gender fluid, gender queer, but leave people who have nothing to do with your community alone. It really is hard to comprehend the fact that cis people who feel ok in their own skin are ridiculed and called cis scum while trans people are whining about how oppressive our existence alone is. I understand hating transphobic people and bigots, but this is just stupid. This is the reason why tumblr is a joke to the masses and why you, trans people are a joke to many. How can people take you people seriously when you yell about privileges that cis people have, but then act like you’re a special snowflake and higher than everybody else. I’m for equality for everybody, but being an ass won’t get you shit. \n\nTo sum it up the tumblr communities suck and are full of idiots, bigots and assholes, but of course in every community there are people who do think with their head and are great individuals.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"autogynephiliacbrat","id":97413802138,"post_url":"http://autogynephiliacbrat.tumblr.com/post/97413802138/hrt-month-7ish","slug":"hrt-month-7ish","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-13 21:12:42 GMT","timestamp":1410642762,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"PectjYaa","tags":["yaye","me","my face","trans","transsexual","trans woman","transgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZYX9Fs1QkKAYQ","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":12,"caption":"HRT month 7ish","image_permalink":"http://autogynephiliacbrat.tumblr.com/image/97413802138","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":496,"height":331,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6139081af11d5274733195ab4a8268c2/tumblr_nbuyx6iPlO1sqz0hlo1_500.gif"},{"width":400,"height":267,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6139081af11d5274733195ab4a8268c2/tumblr_nbuyx6iPlO1sqz0hlo1_400.gif"},{"width":250,"height":167,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6139081af11d5274733195ab4a8268c2/tumblr_nbuyx6iPlO1sqz0hlo1_250.gif"},{"width":100,"height":67,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6139081af11d5274733195ab4a8268c2/tumblr_nbuyx6iPlO1sqz0hlo1_100.gif"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6139081af11d5274733195ab4a8268c2/tumblr_nbuyx6iPlO1sqz0hlo1_75sq.gif"}],"original_size":{"width":496,"height":331,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6139081af11d5274733195ab4a8268c2/tumblr_nbuyx6iPlO1sqz0hlo1_500.gif"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"plaid-n-converse","id":97413681675,"post_url":"http://plaid-n-converse.tumblr.com/post/97413681675/i-took-this-right-when-lightning-hit-the-ground","slug":"i-took-this-right-when-lightning-hit-the-ground","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-13 21:11:00 GMT","timestamp":1410642660,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"b8O197sU","tags":["trans","me","auburn"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZAZuPq1QkJj8B","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"caption":"I took this right when lightning hit the ground near my house.

I’ve relaxed a billion percent about other drama, I don’t need to stress on new not real drama.\n\nBut it’s nice having someone text me that they think I’m pretty. I don’t think so, but that’s partially from growing up the “smart” girl and not the “pretty” one. Because our culture sucks and says you can only have one. \n\nBut wow am I distracted.

I live my life the way I want and I don’t disturb anyone’s life by doing so.

I’m a trained pharmacist and speak five languages fluently, and until recently, I was studying for an MBA in Health Administration in Taiwan on a government scholarship. I also used to be a man.\n\nLast year, I was forced to travel to Hong Kong to renew my passport because of my altered gender. […] Little did I know my life would be turned upside down when I boarded that plane. […]\n\nOn arrival at Hong Kong’s sprawling international airport, immigration officials reacted with a combination of confusion and hostility after looking at my travel documents. I arrived as a woman but my passport identified me as a man. […]\n\nI was detained in a cramped room at the airport and permitted access to the male toilet only, despite my repeated requests to be allowed to use the female facilities.\n\nA deportation letter was soon issued to me, which meant Hong Kong authorities were forcing me to leave. I feared I’d be sent back to Colombia, a place I had left because I suffered discrimination and violent abuse — including two murder attempts — precisely because I’m transgender. […]\n\nWhile the process to become a refugee can take years, the situation was so clear for the agency that full status was conferred in only 12 days. September 30 last year marked the day I became a “stateless person.” I had effectively surrendered my nationality.[…]\n\nThe struggle for many like me continues, but there is always hope. When it seems there is not a clear reason to continue fighting, my life still has a meaning — being myself, being Eliana.”\n\nRead the whole

Everyone is nice and stuff and the teachers are hecka [these are teachers from my imaginary dream school and I’m sitting here thinking they somehow crawled out of my imagination and became a living being]. I really like being there but there’s also the thing where I don’t want to be shoved back into the closet. I’ve already said I was pansexual (panromantic but I am not going to deal with explaining that to everyone), and it was subtle but I didn’t hesitate. I kind got into a topic at lunch with new friends having to do with how everyone at the school was cute as fuck and I just sort of said “Yeah but you’re not pansexual.” and they were cool with it. But that’s not the part of the closet I’m worried about.\n\nI want people to know I’m a guy. Like everyone (excluding every teacher besides my spanish teacher, and my friend from before school started) uses feminine pronouns. I want to tell them I’m a guy but instead of just going, “Oh, I’m sorry, my mistake. So he [continues previous conversation].” they will most likely go along the lines of, “Oh, I thought you were a girl. Sorry.

I just — It’s not that I give two shits about what they call me or think of me afterward, just as long as they know I’m a guy.

Seto Koji’s Blog 2\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nファントム\n\n城田優主演、ミュージカル『ファントム』を観に行った。\n\n甘く切ない“愛”が沢山詰まった作品。\n\nその愛を繊細に残酷に描いた作品だった。\n\n事務所の先輩が城田さん含め3人出演している。\n\n まずは主人公、エリックを演じる城田優さん。\n\n城田さんがD-BOYSだった頃から知っているが、どんな事をやるにもズバ抜けていて、到底敵わないという印象。\n\n今回のミュージカル『ファントム』でも、堂々とした立ち姿、歌唱力、芝居で凄まじいオーラを放っていた。\n\n主人公、エリックの繊細さ、可愛らしさがしっかり伝わってきた。\n\nいつも堂々としている城田さんだが、本人も本当は緊張しいで、1人で悩んでいたりとエリックみたいな性格の持ち主なのではないだろうか…\n\n瀬戸はそう分析しました。\n\nそしてオペラ座の支配人、ゲラール・キャリエールを演じる吉田栄作さん。\n\nん～、この作品を知らない人にはネタバレになりそうで書けないな～。\n\nとにかく僕は泣きました。\n\n男とはいえ人間は弱い生き物で、なかなか強くなれない。\n\nそんな切ない男を熱演されてます。\n\nあ～、言いたい！\n\n最後にオペラ座の新プリマドンナ、カルロッタを演じるマルシアさん。\n\n存在感が半端ではない。\n\n指先や体の動きも個性的で、舞台に出てくる度に目を奪われてしまう。\n\n歌唱力はもちろん、セリフや歌っている時の声色の切り替え、僕大好きです。\n\nまだまだ魅力たっぷりのミュージカル『ファントム』、皆さんも是非足を運んでみて下さい。\n\n出演者・スタッフの皆さん、素晴らしい作品をありがとうございました！\n\nミュージカル『ファントム』の公式HPはコチラ\n\nPhantom\n\nI went to see the musical “Phantom”, starring Shirota Yuu.\n\nIts a work that is packed with sweet and painful “love”.\n\nIts a work that draws out the cruelty of a delicate love.\n\nShirota-san, a senior in the office, and 2 others are in the film.\n\n Firstly the protagonist, Erik played by Shirota Yuu.\n\nAlthough I’ve known Shirota-san from D-BOYS, whatever he does he would excel in it, I have that impression of him where no matter what (he does) there is no match for him.\n\nIn this musical “Phantom” too, with a magnificent posture, singing ability, letting out a tremendous aura during the play.\nThe protagonist, Erik’s delicacy, has been expressed clearly in a cute way.\n\nEven though Shirota-san always look dignified, but he does get really nervous, being troubled by himself and I wonder if he has the personality like Erik…\n\nThat’s what Seto has realized. \n\n And the manager of the opera house, Gérard Carrière played by Yoshida Eisaku-san.\n\nHmm, I shall not write spoilers for people who do not know the story of this work~.\n\nAnyways I cried.\n\nAlthough man said that humans are weak creatures, and can’t get stronger.\n\nHe performed enthusiastically as a role of a sad man.\n\nAh~ I want to say (something)!\n\n At the end, the new prima donna of the opera house, Carlotta played by Marcia-san.\n\nHer presence is of no joke.\n\nThe movements of her fingertips and her body is distinctive, whenever she gets on stage, you would be captivated by her.\n\nOf course her singing skills (is good), the switching of tone between her singing and dialogue, I

My weekend is turning out to be very busy, and we want to take nice photos in natural light and its been a bit rainy. Its sad that I can’t, but I love the rain.\n\nToday, after getting through the aches and umpfs of waking up, I felt so calm. It was wonderful. I felt like I had more clarity, as well, and that the day was going to be fantastic. And it was pretty fantastic, despite some wannabe arsonist tossing my water bottle into the fire pit at my favorite bar. I’m not even mad, just a bit aggravated that, with money so tight, I’m going to have to toss down fifteen bucks for a new one. But regardless, we got invited out by a generous friend and I had a wonderful time.\n\nMy big change for today, I guess may not be as coincidental as I thought. Apparently, vision changes can happen depending on how your body deals with HRT. I noticed first that signs far away from me were near illegible, despite having my corrective lenses in. That was a bit distressing, but not terribly so. On the other hand, I noticed that colors are amazingly, gorgeously vibrant!

I love you, deer of dawn.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nI stayed with my uncle when I was young, and my cousin was only six years older than me. He was a very unruly kid, but he had an almost extreme dedication/passion for cars.\n\n  His family wanted him to study, get into college and become a doctor, and so they nagged at him everyday, but he could (only wanted to) study things related to cars/things about cars, and the area of car models in his room far exceeds the area occupied by his bed. When he was seventeen, he ran away from home and nobody knew where he went. When I was in high school, relatives from 安徽 (An Hui - a place in China) brought back the message that he was managing a car dealing company there and business was good. The family wanted my uncle to contact him (get in touch with him) but my uncle was equally stubborn and so he furiously rejected the idea.\n\n  The year I was done with high school, we heard (from people in An Hui) that my cousin got injured and broke his leg while on his way to discuss a contract. My uncle took a flight there in a rush, and he brought back my cousin, who was tanned, skinny and walking with a limp. Over a meal (a family meal), my cousin suddenly started crying, and his tears fell in the soup bowl.\n\n  My uncle wordlessly changed the bowl, and told him, “Eat, it’s getting cold.”\n\n  ———\n\n  It’s said that to be a good man, one has to dare to venture, and to be a real man one has to be able to get out there and shoulder (responsibilities), doing whatever possible (no matter how tough) to earn a living and support his family back home, and he would do anything to cover a gunshot wound on his shoulder with a shoulder of medals (this basically means earning glory and honour at the expense of injuries etc).\n\n  No matter how bruised and battered, but at the very least he had achievements and had done his parents proud. I always thought that was what growing up meant.\n\n  But that day I suddenly came to an understanding. The ones who love you don’t care for whether or not the place you are standing is full of glory and glamour, they care more about whether or not you have a bowl of steamy rice before you when you’re hungry, whether or not you have someone accompanying you when you’re sick, when you’re in pain, and when you’re struck down and at a loss of what to do.\n\n  ——-\n\n  I used to ask/expect a lot of/from you.\n\n  I wished for you to keep improving, to step up to the top of thus world, and I wished for you to seize every opportunity possible so the next day, you can become the eternally shining star everyone knows about. I once was like many others, getting angry because you couldn’t get the things we felt you deserved (because of your losses, basically), and it was hard for me to sleep and eat, and like a revolutionary soldier, I forwent sleep to send the same email all night.\n\n  Back then, a lot of those who have gotten in touch with you were already saying that there were issues with your health. But back then, I was blinded by the desire I had built upon you, and I fervently joined the almost ritualistic activities that I’ve been anticipating for a long time.\n\n  And just an hour before I read the news, I was thinking, once the concert is over, I must continue sending those emails, I must not let you be the only one left with nothing to do (no schedules). (We) Must let everything that can possibly happen happen to you (meaning to give the best possible arrangements etc to Luhan).\n\n  ——\n\n  The instant I saw the news, the picture, all the wishes that had been so loud and fervent inside me lost their voices. And all the details which had been overlooked resurfaced.\n\n  I remember, in February, during an interview, when you talked about going into the sea in the middle of winter, you used the words 千刀万剐 (like being sliced ten thousand times by a thousand knives).\n\n  I remember, in April, I saw with my own eyes, after your dance performance had ended, you were panting heavily, hidden in a corner where the light couldn’t reach.\n\n  I remember, back when the group was promoting Miracles In December, your eyes were bloodshot from fever, I remember you turning away from the microphone during the recording for Happy Camp to cough as softly as possible, I remember you massaging/hitting your thigh, in pain, when you were rehearsing for SMTOWN, and I remember how you deliberately tried to hide the tremble/instability in your walk back in Xi An (airport?).\n\n  ——\n\n  You left home at the age of eighteen to a foreign land for your studies, and behind you stood so many people who didn’t understand your decision, or perhaps wholly disapproved of your choices. I once imagined you, that month of that year, in a foreign place, having to wait - without anything you can expect to happen/without anything you can count on happening - even if you had clenched your teeth (a metaphor for waiting, enduring) until your whole mouth tasted of acid.\n\n  At the age of eighteen, most of us won’t have to struggle to feed and support the family, and the only faith we have to support us is to give this world a tight, loud slap with our own hands, to prove that our determination is not for a mere daydream, to prove that we can live a fruitful life as we are supported by our own youthful dreams.\n\n  And you did indeed live humbly, staying silent in spite of all the hardships you were going through. And most of us, at your age, no matter what, wouldn’t have dared to take such a gamble and held our breath through it all. That was the majority which you had set yourself apart from, and you fought on, all by yourself, and in the tough silence you finally made your way to the front of the crowd.\n\n  I really wish to know, that year, in your phone call home, if you were always like the “you” captured by all the lenses this year, always full of life and energy, as if by standing there, there would be an infallible wall (protecting you).\n\n  ——-\n\n  And then you debuted, and it appeared as though you valued (having to shoulder all those responsibilities), having all those labels stuck on you, and you had to be careful even when you speak. A single tree standing out amongst the forest faces the danger of being the first to fall/to be destroyed, and so one must fight the merciless wind and rain. And you stayed the same, just like the “you” when you first set sail.\n\n  That year, on stage, you held the microphone and said buwangchuxin (to never forget the heart you set sailed with/to never forget one’s original goals and purpose and attitude etc), and you were so sincere, I thought you were making/reading a vow. And then, just like you said, you carried yourself as if you would never tire.\n\n  Do you remember when you said when you first started playing the rubric cube, and you just couldn’t resist and had to hold it in your hands and practise? That moment, I guessed that you’re someone who always asked too much of himself, and as long as you’re learning something, you pay more attention than anyone on the details, even if you’re always practising. In the days following that, at the airports and in between recordings, you are always seen dancing the moves you’ve been dancing hundreds and thousands of times, just because you’re scared of making one mistake. \n\n  I really wanted to live my life the way you do, but I know there isn’t a second person who has developed the same unyielding power you have. They can be just like you, but they’re not /you/.\n\n  ——\n\n  The song that you participated in shot to fame and so, you got to stand on countless stages to receive all the awards. Only once did your eyes turn red. That year, at the end of the year, you looked into the camera and said what your new year resolution was. You said, you want to be someone outstanding.\n\n  Finally, I couldn’t bring myself to try feeling whatever it was that you’re feeling, I couldn’t possibly guess, as you were repeatedly practising all those dances and all those songs, just how vast is/was the sky that you’re aiming for.\n\n  I’ve seen for myself that you’re already standing at the peak where many others have to spend a great deal more time to reach, so why do I feel that your eyes are still filled with the anticipation and eagerness they contained when you first set sailed?\n\n  Finally, this year, the year I had predicted that would dim all the glow/shine. Your 本命年 (), as if it’s been cursed.\n\n  With your new identity and all the new awards you’ve earned, and with a life more splendid than the ones others have ever lived, and having received more love than before. I thought you would be able to withstand all that would come your way and you would gain more than you would lose.\n\n  Eventually, your eyes stopped smiling as much as they once did.\n\n  —-\n\n  You joined the cast for a movie, and you always responded shyly to being well liked by the seniors. Back then I’ve heard many stories about you on set, and you were someone who carefully studied everything, even a single move involving cycling.\n\n  And then there was that incident about sasaengs, and the essay we wrote about you “being used to it” were shared by tens of thousands. We penned down all the hardships and sorrow with every word we typed, but we dared not think, once more, just how much you, you who had experienced all those things firsthand, have suffered and endured.\n\n  It was then that we realised how scary your tolerance was, to have been able to laugh in spite of all the pressure life has thrown at you, even if it had been just for the sake of comforting those who care for you, those who are pained by your sufferings.\n\n  ——\n\n  For two whole years, you’ve always appeared as if you are infallible, and now, I finally understand the truth behind that infallible front of yours.\n\n  That tree I had thought would never fall, had exhausted all of his energy just to work hard in order to stand tall, stand upright.\n\n  And as opposed to wanting to see you conquer your quest of chasing the stars (in stardom), now, I would rather see you go home for a good meal.\n\n  I wish to see you step off that stage, and walk towards the lights that will guide you home.\n\n  There, they won’t care of you could wield the wind and rule the world, they would only care about whether or not you’re hungry.\n\n  There, they won’t even be able to stand to see you suffer from the smallest injuries at work, let alone see every part of you bogged down by said injuries.\n\n  ——\n\n  I once hoped that you, Luhan, would always belong to the stage, belong to us, but the stage, at the end, hasn’t returned us a healthy and happy “you”.\n\n  You said, you wish everyone is healthy, happy and together with their families.\n\n  But you’re always miles away from home, from your family, and you, in the midst of the applause given to you by healthy, happy fans, are the only one who can neither stay healthy nor happy.\n\n  Then go home and be united with your family, I suppose, that Luhan who belongs to his father and mother, should be able to give us a carefree and long-lived ” you”. \n\n  ——-\n\n  My dearest, you must be tired.\n\n  You really don’t have to keep striving to prove anything anymore. To us, to the ones who love you most, you’ve proven a great deal - you’ve proven far too much.\n\n  I know that in your heart, there is world at your evey beck and call, it’s vast, so vast that we can never see its limits. But you don’t have to rush to expand your territories and your domains, because you’re still young, and even if you pause to take a break, the world will still remain by your side.\n\n  And so please, do wait a while, rest a while, and work hard to eat an extra bowl of rice.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"procryptic","id":97372940424,"post_url":"http://procryptic.tumblr.com/post/97372940424/im-cute","slug":"im-cute","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-13 10:32:42 GMT","timestamp":1410604362,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"5WcLYiVd","tags":["face","me","queerbabesnet","trans","ftm","queer","love me"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZFjXHv1QhuIY8","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":26,"caption":"I’m cute","image_permalink":"http://procryptic.tumblr.com/image/97372940424","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":750,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":375,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":150,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/927b298d939145298b12e199be235b81/tumblr_nbu5aia2001rw9idyo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"feministroosterteeth","id":97372365006,"post_url":"http://feministroosterteeth.tumblr.com/post/97372365006/i-am-very-uneducated-on-this-subject-but-i-was-just","slug":"i-am-very-uneducated-on-this-subject-but-i-was-just","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-13 10:15:45 GMT","timestamp":1410603345,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"QJPeIHeY","tags":["Anonymous","trans","transgender","transphobia","transmisogyny","misgendering","violence","frtasks","cissexism"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZHQdjr1Qhs63E","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"I am very uneducated on this subject but I was just wondering, if a boy that feels like a girl and dresses like a girl and whatnot attacks a non trans girl is that okay?

You say you’re just not educated & not trying to be disrespectful and I appreciate that, but please read the Trans 101 so that you can become more educated, because a trans woman isn’t a boy, and that’s a really bad thing to insinuate.\n\nSecondly, I’m not 100% sure what you’re asking. No one should really attack anyone, but I’m frankly more concerned with cis people attacking trans women than vice versa.

Initially it was every 12 weeks, but due to not having sufficient testosterone, it was changed to every 10 weeks earlier this year. Fortunately endocrinologist visits are free of charge but testosterone isn’t here and there is no scheme of insurance that safeguards trans individuals. I also had to pay for psychiatric evaluation privately since at hospital I had to wait months on the waiting list without being evaluated.\n\nTestosterone costs me 140 euros per shot, that’s about 700 euros a year. My only income currently is my student stipend, which is mostly spent on school material and bus fares, with occasional purchases of books. I also need to buy some compressing bras and an FTM swimsuit. I haven’t been to the beach in a long time and my last swim was two years ago in a small pool. I really feel insecure about the top part of my body but top surgery is out of the question at the moment since it costs too much, I would need to move out because my family doesn’t support me and I have no one to take care of me when I’d be weak from surgery.\n\nUnfortunately my first Indiegogo campaign proved unsuccessful because I only raised 1 euro.\n\nI have now made a new Indiegogo campaign for this same purpose. \n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-me-pay-my-testosterone—2/x/6918674\n\nI would be very thankful if you lend me a hand and feel free to ask questions.

We do not approve of the things they are posting and advise that they be avoided, as well.\n\nThis will be a more informal post due to this tumblr user having been covered in the past by multiple TDS members and other truscum members on their personal blogs.\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that Khase is calling user genderfag a cis man [x]. Khase has been called out by various members of TDS for this in the past and has been previously marked as a problematic member that is to be avoided for the exact same actions of:\n\nmisgendering dysphoric individuals in the past and doing so with user genderfag [x] [x] [x]\n  harassing (admitted in a previous link) \nAnd faking a suicide in order to guilt those that had called him out [x] [x]. \nAn apology was given for these actions and assured everyone that they would not do this again, but as seen this is not the case as he is misgendering user genderfag.\n\nDo not contact any of the users mentioned in these posts to send harmful messages of any kind, we simply advise to avoid.\n\n-Agent BloodFox\n\nDue to Khase having been problematic several times in the past, there’s little reason to give him another chance - in my opinion. How each individual handles this is their own business.\n\nRegardless; even if someone disagrees with you, even if they are being horrible to you, even if they misgender you first, do not attack them. Do not misgender them, do not use slurs against them, do not threaten them, do not tell them to die. Do not become that person.\n\nAll this achieves is hurting others in ways no one deserves to be hurt, and it damages the entire truscum movement because your words seem to speak for all of us. \n\nAnd once again, because this bears repeating, don’t attack even if you are attacked first.

They were drawn to “feminine” things, like dresses and dolls and make up. And while girls don’t have to even like feminine things, this royal felt like girl fit them better than boy. They always wished to be a girl since they were little.\n\nBut in their teens they learned more about trans people, and realized that if they identified as a girl, that would mean that they were a girl. They realized that they had always really been a girl.\n\nBut her parents would not hear of such things. Once she came out to them, they refused to accept that she was a girl and banned her from “feminine” things, thinking that would somehow stop her from being a girl. She was forced to remain in the closet, only ever revealing her true self to her best friend. She was forced to only learn and do things that her parents considered “boyish”. Sword fighting being the only one she actually enjoyed.\n\nSo the young princess grew up, unable to show her true self to her people. Sheltered by her parents. Her parents kept her hidden from the public as much as her parents could get away with. Her younger brother, on the other hand, they took great pride in.\n\nHe was the heir. He loved his sister and accepted her, but could not do much about how horrid their parents were.\n\nThe princess had to stay in the closet… Until one day…\n\nOn the way to a meeting with a neighboring kingdom (which she of course was not invited to, since her parents considered her the black sheep in the family), her parent’s train hit another train head on.\n\nHer parents were killed.\n\nShe was depressed for about a month, but then decided that she actually didn’t care much. Her parents never cared for her. They were ashamed of her. Their deaths would not change the mental abuse and transphobia they had shown her her entire life. They were not worthy of being called her parents. Their deaths did not mean that she owed them any respect.\n\nHer brother was more torn up about it, but finally got better after two months of mourning. Once he got out of his depression, he made a shocking proclamation:\n\n“There is no better person to rule this kingdom than Riley. They deserve it more than I do. I relinquish my rights to the crown to them.”\n\nRiley was shocked. A few weeks later, her brother left to fight in a war. He writes home sometimes.\n\nToday Riley is 17. She struggles with her gender identity. Now that her parents are gone, she is trying to regain the love for her real gender and overcome the transphobic insults, misgendering, and invalidation her parents had forced upon her.\n\nWill she come out to her subjects? Will she be able to be herself? Or will transphobia keep her in the closet? How will things work out for her?\n\nIn just two months, she will be crowned ruler of the kingdom. Will she stay in the closet and accept being crowned a king?

You hid it all and didn’t tell anyone else what was going on. But a little bit of courage built every day. And the conviction came that it was now and you were going to do… something. Maybe not shout it from the rooftops, but tell someone close. You were going to share your pain.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. Her name was Gwen and she was your age and she lived less than fifty miles away. At first she was missing, but there was no real doubt. She had been killed. She was seventeen. You were seventeen. She had been living as you wanted to and she was killed for that. They blamed their rage on her existence. These murderers so much like the boys you called friends. They buried her in the woods. You would only look up the news stories late at night after everyone else had gone to bed because there was only one computer and the whole family used it. You hid her pictures in a folder buried deep on the computer—a place no one else would ever even look—and erased your history. You would do the same the next night and the next and the next and the next and try to follow the case even though nothing changed and she was dead and that wouldn’t change. In your history class the only teacher you ever heard talk about this killing, who called it a tragedy, also called Gwen by the wrong name. You told no one.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. You realized there was no one to talk to about this. No one to mention this death that was so removed and so close to you. Gwen was dead and you never knew her but you wished you had. You weren’t part of the cool queer outcasts—a group of maybe two at your school. You were some stupid jock playing baseball and skipping class to go to the movies. You weren’t even supposed to know the word transgender. You were called fag only ever in a joking way—just like all the guys called each other—not with the menace of violence behind it. There was no way for them to know the fear you held.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. You had worn girls clothing, two sizes too small and stolen from your sister, under your jeans. You did this in September of 2002 but after October 3rd you never did it again. You went from being kind of a loner to having no friends at all. You felt close to no one. You skipped class even more. You wrote a short story in first person from a female perspective—but just as an exercise, you tell the classmates you didn’t realize would be reading it. You tried your best to control your voice and listen and hope they don’t notice your panicked sweat. You think of the frying pan they struck her with. The shovel they left to get and then used to strike her unconscious body. The rope they strangled her with. You know there’s no real chance of that but the images come to your mind because this was the only other seventeen-year-old trans girl in the world you’d ever heard of. It was just you and her and she was dead now and you were alone. Gwen you never knew.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. It was so easy being the withdrawn jock. Just play baseball and drive away to eat lunch each day. No one will ever ask more from you. Sure, you’re grades are too low to go to college even though everyone you know is applying. And yeah it’s not like you’re good enough at baseball to have a future there. Hell, you hardly see the field that year. You’re just some dumb C- student who will probably start working construction with your dad and brothers after high school. What else could you even hope for. What other option is there. You saw what happens when you let it out and show people. They buried it back down for you in a shallow grave.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. When you took the Army aptitude test you get a perfect score on their intelligence measure—it’s not really a hard test. You were never really dumb, just shitty at school, and everyone knew that so no one is surprised or anything. But when the recruiter comes and talks to you and asks you to sign papers and go in for a physical and mentions college it’s the first time you believe that escape is real and so even though it’s the last damn thing you want you sign up and after you do and the dread sets in you don’t understand that quitting is an option and you can walk away. You sign your letter to join the Army in March of 2003 and on the radio on the way back home with your father they announce that the first bombs have been dropped on Iraq. You are seventeen and have another year of high school left still, but it’s okay, they have a special program for you to start early.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. Your sense of doom and depression climb and climb and at least you stop actively thinking about her and how they killed her just for breathing. You move from station to station as the school year ends and boot camp begins and on the plane you hide the tears from the sleeping middle aged man next to you. You imagine elaborate fantasies of leaving almost upon arrival. The other recruits seem just as nervous and uncertain as you though and there’s at least some comfort in that. And by the time they drive you to camp you’re so lost that you wouldn’t even know which direction to flee. Eventually you find a map and you try to figure out how long you’d have before they would discover your empty bed and maybe it would be better to try and convince some other scared guy to make out but then everyone would think you were gay and you’ve convinced yourself that was worse than this. So you push through. You’re bright and athletic and used to hiding your emotions. You are very good at basic training, for whatever that’s worth.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. When you return people look at you weird. You are technically a soldier, but you’ve done nothing other than gone to a camp where some people yell at you for ten weeks. Your one friend, the one who was taking the damn test so you tagged along with in the first place, the one you don’t even really care about but he’s probably just as lonely as you and it’s easier to stand next to someone before school than no one, he’s joining the Marines after school’s out and so you talk about military stuff. That is until you freak out and drive 500 miles south before turning right around because you just need to leave. Your life gets put on pause in some ways—you don’t have to deal with school other than a half an hour in a small room out in the woods where a teacher asks you about what you’ve read lately and gives you some math worksheets. And you have to drive thirty miles one weekend a month to stand around and not know what to do while people work in an office and wear army fatigues. Eventually you just stop showing up to these and somehow this was all you needed to do to get discharged. Finally your passivity pays off. Of course you don’t know this at the time and you dread the eventual meetings and talks and is this even legal? Can they put you in prison for this? You don’t see why not.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. You graduate and start working at a lumber yard and everything seems back to the track you were on. But at the last minute you decide to attend the community college and sign up for whatever class you can. You get a really great English teacher in this accelerated pace class designed to help students transfer quicker. It is the perfect match for you. You’ve never done so well in school in your life—not even to the earliest years when you could never avoid trouble and would sometimes start crying if things went wrong. You even have a plan set that will free you from this place. You start to see the shape of a life that’s not so bad. Yeah, the depression and dysphoria come to visit you often, but at least in those other days it feels like you could maybe be okay. Not happy, but okay. You’ve never thought that was an option before.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. The life you were living was getting better and others seemed happy for you but you didn’t feel it at all. You constantly circled back to those trans thoughts and spent hours wandering down what-if paths. You wanted nothing more than to run away again from this good, respectable life you were building. You pushed away a woman you loved in no small part because you wanted and feared a future with her. You had to hide your thoughts from her and resented her for asking so often what is wrong. You couldn’t answer and said nothing and magnified her faults in your mind. And when you dump her you think it’s better and now you can find someone who will make you happy, even though you’ve never been happy.\n\nMaybe it was this way for you too. You saw it all clearly and the cycle was plainly shown. You realized it wasn’t going away. You are 28 and Gwen never got past 17, but she lived more than you ever have. And you know she wasn’t the only trans girl your age. You watch hours and hours worth of timeline videos on youtube and lurk reddit to see the beautiful trans girls who are your age and living proof that you were wrong and this can be done. You realize how much the death of Gwen was a product of the violence trans women of color face and how even though she lived near you and was your age you probably can’t relate to her experience. She faced a violence and oppression that you won’t know. Yet you still think of her and wonder if anyone else knows her name. How could you ever even begin to explain to someone just how important she was to your life. How could you ever begin to talk about her. What could you even say. She was born in the same year as you, nine months before you, and she was killed because she was a girl like you. You were just beginning to understand how real this was and name what it was. It was getting clear and you were thinking of ways to make it real and live that life and then they killed her for being a girl. That was the price. She was the only other trans girl in the world and they had killed her. But she wasn’t the only one. You were a trans girl too even if you ran from that and tried to ignore it into oblivion. You are trans and that never changes. You are trans and many others are too. You hid and you ran but that’s okay. You did what you had to survive and yeah it sucks that you weren’t really living your life for the last ten years like you could have been, but you’re here. You are twenty-eight and trans and a women and have hormones and all of that seemed so fucking impossible to you in October of 2002. You are alive and scared but ready to exist.

You zoomed in on ONE word in my entire ask. I used it mostly because there's a character limit. What I meant is that they haven't actually said \"I'm trans\", they would be deciding to say something, confirm it with them self, I guess. And, no, actually, I have never once told them that they shouldn't be trans or that its a bad thing. I haven't said anything negative to them on the subject at all. I also think that if that's what they really feel and want","answer":"[2/3] (okay I lied it was more than two) then they should absolutely go for it. Being my best friend, I WILL support them no matter what happens. I don’t want them to feel worse if that’s not what they really are in the end. No, I dont know them better than them self, but I do know them better than you. They can’t just say “Oh, I guess I was cis afterall.” and be fine. It would destroy them to be so wrong about something. One more point is that I have nothing against trans people at all. I don’t think that lots and lots of trans people are only like that from past trauma, I think they’re people who genuinely feel different than the set norm and make steps to be their true self, as you could say. No, I don’t know a super duper lot about trans people. I’ve never met one in my life. So, yes, I might say something that offends you, because I know language is really important to you. Its mostly because I don’t know what words and phrases you might use, so I’m sorry if I get it wrong.\n\nI’m glad to hear that you intend to support your friend whatever they may do, but I zoomed in on ‘one word’ for an important reason - trans people do not ‘decide’ to be trans, and that’s an important distinction to make. I’m glad that it was a result of limited space rather than thinking that we do ‘decide’ to be trans (as opposed to maybe making a decision regarding how & when we transition, which some of us do make a decision on), but I stand by my correction, because I couldn’t know unless you clarified.\n\nI don’t know why you came to me for help if you’re going to resist what I tell you. I appreciate that you’re not going to get the wording right all the time, but it’s still important to maybe find out a bit more about trans people and start learning the terminology, to help your friend, especially if they do realise they are trans.\n\nThe best thing for your friend, if they are questioning, is to let them question and to support them through it. Yes, they might realise they are not trans, and that might be a blow to them, but it’s still an important step for some people.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"transoregon","id":97341034397,"post_url":"http://transoregon.tumblr.com/post/97341034397/theres-transmasculine-and-transfemine-groups-that-meet","slug":"theres-transmasculine-and-transfemine-groups-that-meet","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-13 00:28:00 GMT","timestamp":1410568080,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"UOpdpuSn","tags":["portland","q center","transmasculine","transfeminine","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zs1ahw1Qf_a_T","followed":false,"post_author":"oddment-tweak","highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"asking_name":"lionsmustroamfree","asking_url":"http://lionsmustroamfree.tumblr.com/","question":"There's transmasculine and transfemine groups that meet at the Q Center every week.

If they’re having a hard time in life right now, I guarantee you that you are 100% not helping by questioning their gender identity and by assuming that you know their mind better than they do (you don’t).\n\nYou are being transphobic under the guise of being concerned. I don’t think you mean to be transphobic, I think it comes from a place of not knowing rather than maliciousness, but it doesn’t change the fact that this is what you are doing. No one ‘decides’ to be trans. Support your friend, unconditionally. Be there for them if they are trans, be there for them if they’re not.\n\nAlso, read this and do a little research on trans people.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"muppetmolly","id":97338331974,"post_url":"http://muppetmolly.tumblr.com/post/97338331974/if-you-were-to-get-in-an-accident-and-suddenly","slug":"if-you-were-to-get-in-an-accident-and-suddenly","type":"quote","date":"2014-09-12 23:48:00 GMT","timestamp":1410565680,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"NWeAEt1u","tags":["trans","transgender","lgbtqia"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zbsbpt1QfqHD6","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":13,"text":"If you were to get in an accident and suddenly lose your penis, are you any less of a man?

Their brain is telling them that the outside appearance of their body does not fit how they feel on the inside, if you can grasp this simple concept then you can grasp how we feel.","source":"Comment

When did the lines between verbal and written expression start to blur? I mean, half my life has been spent orating, whether it be at my job, to my friends or to myself as I sit alone in the car. But now, as I sit in front of a keyboard, I struggle to articulate this tangled mass of emotions I have trapped inside. Not to say that it’s any easier, trying to sort through it aloud. But at least in that respect I can bullshit my point across… At least, I can most days.\n\nFake it until you make it, right? That’s what my dear old Dad used to say.\n\nNo, for the most part I’m totally and utterly blocked. Which sucks, especially considering the fact I have a new love vibrating in my chest, bouncing from corridor to corridor, urging to be free. Maybe that’s where all this tangible, physical pain is coming from? (At least, I like to joke that way in my head.) But seriously. It’s storybook love, the kind I haven’t felt since high school - that shout it from the rooftops kind of reaffirming love. And guess what? \n\nHe’s trans*.\n\nWhich is not of course, the defining aspect to his character. Oh no, when I think of Alec, I think of those fertile blue-green eyes set against his alabaster skin, or the way his dark hair falls when he tips his head against the pillow. Or the way he knows instictively how to curve his lips to mine in a way I haven’t felt all my life. I mean, for fuck’s sake, I was with Jamie for four or five years and not once did he try to adapt to me. No, I was the one forced to change, mold, adapt. But with Alec, I for once feel free. I feel closer and closer to being… Me.\n\nBut he’s trans*. Which poses a small problem.\n\nNot for my Dad, gods bless him. Despite his total inadequacy as a parent, I will eternally credit him for being my best friend. “As long as you’re happy, I’m happy,” he said. He could care less. In fact, my non-binary gender sort of lends itself well to Alec, which is something he noted later on. And you know, it poses no problems for my immediate friends, either. They all adore him. No, the only concern I have is in relation to my super religious co-workers and even then (as I try to be the best ally I can) I of course, refuse to out him. But he doesn’t pass well. After all, he came out for the first time in March. They haven’t met him. All they know is that I’m seeing a guy named Alec and as far as I’m concerned, that’s all they need to know.\n\nBut still. I love him! I want to take him to our work christmas party and show him off in a vest and tie. I want to declare in front of God and everyone that this is the person for me. But I’m not the issue. It’s about making him feel comfortable. I’d rather stab myself in the leg than see him misgendered. slandered or abused.\n\nAnd then there is a whole other issue in the form of my best friend Amber. She saw my graceful departure from Jamie a few months back and as I suspected, began to feel the same. Now, she’s having doubts about her own boyfriend. But.. They’re presenting themselves in the form of another. Like, another guy. And I hate to watch her do this to herself and to him. Eric is a good person. Jobless? Sure. Sometimes callous with a complete and utter lack of motivation? Sure. But who isn’t twenty-something and at least a little bit like that? I certainly have no room to talk, at least when it comes to motivation. But he’s also loyal, patient, considerate and kind. Were she to work up the courage to talk to him about it, I’m more than certain they might’ve worked through some of these issues. But instead she was afraid. And now, the love very well may be gone.\n\nBut wait! There’s more. I have axillary swelling under my armpit that is totally mysterious. Chest pain that comes and goes. Blood work? Fine. Ultrasound? No lumps! Gee, I wonder what’s wrong with me? WHO KNOWS? Not my doctor, that’s for sure.\n\nBut the drinking certainly helps… As does the cymbalta. Or at least, it seems to be helping.\n\nAnyway, that’s all for now. Maybe I’ll write a little bit about Alec later if the spirit takes me.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"whothefisscott","id":97331620211,"post_url":"http://whothefisscott.tumblr.com/post/97331620211/hey-can-we-destroy-the-idea-that-only-trans","slug":"hey-can-we-destroy-the-idea-that-only-trans","type":"text","date":"2014-09-12 22:13:20 GMT","timestamp":1410560000,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"0WadI428","tags":["gender","pronouns","trans","nonbinary","preferred pronouns","neutrois","agender","genderqueer"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zppeas1QfQgbp","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":48,"title":"","body":"Hey, can we destroy the idea that only trans people should give their preferred pronouns?

With patience, I will build a chorus of light within me that beats back the darkness. \n\nI will learn to forgive.\n\nIt isn’t their fault they cannot see me.

I just said it aloud to myself to see if it feels weird to say, and it’s mostly weird to hear because I haven’t talked in the last 3 hours, and my voice squeaked. But that’s from not using it, not from the T. I’m not that delusional. \n\n<!-- more -->Obviously because it’s the first week, there ain’t a whole lot going on. It’s gonna take a while for the T to get built up in my system and for me to start seeing anything. I can wish and hope that my peach fuzz looks fuzzier, but I know that’s probably just the lighting in my bathroom being nice to me.\n\nI also gave myself my first at-home shot. That was definitely nerve wracking, though I told myself I couldn’t do anything else (like have lunch) until it was done, and I’m a rather food driven critter, so I got it taken care of. \n\nI definitely wasted a little bit of T trying to draw it out. I keep forgetting that the T is as syrupy as it is, so it takes a while to come out of the vial. But that also confuses me because it doesn’t take that long to inject. Weird. I was mostly scared shitless of getting an air bubble in the syringe and killing myself, so I double, triple, and quadruple checked that there weren’t any air bubbles. I foresee that being the thing my anxiety fixates on as this becomes a habit, because I’m already still mildly panicky over it. \n\nActually putting the needle in my thigh wasn’t that bad. It actually hurt less than most shots I’ve had in my arm. I pulled up on the plunger to see if I hit a vein, and there was no blood, so all in all, I’d say it was a good first shot. Though, I’m bleeding a little bit, because my hands were so shaky and I didn’t pull the needle out as quickly or as smoothly as I should have. But live and learn, right?\n\nFollowing putting the band aid on, I decided to grab the box that I usually store my kit in. As someone who struggles/ed with self-harm (like 95% of everyone else on this website), I was pretty ritualistic in where I kept my medical supplies and sharp objects. But i decided it was time that that box had a new use, so I cleaned it out and put my T vial in there, along with extra band aids and alcohol swabs. I’m actually pretty lucky I’ve got a decent stock of decent medical supplies, because the pharmacy only gave me syringes, no swabs or anything else. I think I might buy Batman band aids the next time I go to town, just as a treat for myself, because I’m really just an overgrown child. \n\nSo yeah, that’s week 1.

Martine Rothblatt, the highest-paid female executive in America, was born male. But that is far from the thing that defines her. Just ask her wife. Then ask the robot version of her wife.\nYou guys, yes this is a long read. Yes this is worth the time.\n\n“The highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million last year, is Martine Rothblatt, the founder of United Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical company. Previously, Rothblatt founded Sirius Satellite Radio, but back then, Rothblatt lived as a man. She had sex-reassignment surgery in 1994 and, soon after, published a “slim manifesto that insisted on an overhaul of ‘dimorphic’ (her word) gender categories.” Rothblatt’s gender both doesn’t matter at all and matters entirely to everything she does. Her ambitions are inextricably tied to what’s closest to her as well as the seemingly impossible. United Therapeutics, which was founded after her daughter was diagnosed with a rare disease, aims to do nothing less than use “blue-sky technology to extend life.” Rothblatt is also into artificial intelligence and has created a robot version of her wife. In the end, New York Magazine’s Lisa Miller provides us with a CEO profile unlike any other, but not necessarily one to gawk at. Instead, it’s a success story that has no limits when it comes to work-life balance, business savvy, ambition, and, bottom line, what it means to be human.”","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"lost-in-the-stereo","id":97310212733,"post_url":"http://lost-in-the-stereo.tumblr.com/post/97310212733/they-never-whispered-it-quietly-they-would-always","slug":"they-never-whispered-it-quietly-they-would-always","type":"quote","date":"2014-09-12 16:54:16 GMT","timestamp":1410540856,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"9F19beOI","tags":["her whole talk was wonderful","but this bit really stuck with me","laverne cox","lgbt","trans","trans rights","lgbtqia","lgbt rights","transphobia","mine"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zrmi2x1Qe909z","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"text":"They never whispered it quietly.

And randomly, underarm hair looks darker and a bit thicker.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"caaptains","id":97309119611,"post_url":"http://caaptains.tumblr.com/post/97309119611/search-for-trashy-hipster-twinks-in-your-area","slug":"search-for-trashy-hipster-twinks-in-your-area","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-12 16:35:00 GMT","timestamp":1410539700,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"rU5w1b6B","tags":["it's me","trans","i'm gonna tag it and see what happens this is wild"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZoBZCy1Qe4rHx","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":10,"caption":"search for trashy hipster twinks in your area","photoset_layout":"2","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1080,"height":720,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":267,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":167,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":67,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1080,"height":720,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/66055ea5ef4cf95bc535fe0c199a8c16/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" Photo Booth"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1080,"height":720,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":333,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":267,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":167,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":67,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1080,"height":720,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/44e7267deb30b85d05288583347a9c8a/tumblr_nbsrel2mF11qd32n2o2_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" Photo Booth"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"piercedwiener","id":97309056838,"post_url":"http://piercedwiener.tumblr.com/post/97309056838/is-it-normal-to-be-nb-and-still-have-dysphoria-i","slug":"is-it-normal-to-be-nb-and-still-have-dysphoria-i","type":"text","date":"2014-09-12 16:34:06 GMT","timestamp":1410539646,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"lELhAfMM","tags":["personal","help","tw: dysphoria","trans","maybe?"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZaJqpx1Qe4bz6","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"is it normal to be nb and still have dysphoria?

Don’t define us (or our gender) by our past experiences.

They’re the best when I was with my supportive friends (they’ve even started using female pronouns and I love it), but the worst when I get home. \n\nI’m not 18 yet, so I can’t get kicked out of my house by my parents (legally at least), but that also means I can’t leave on my own terms. \n\nLast night around 4:00 in the morning, I was so upset that I actually started to wish I wasn’t trans. I didn’t want to have to deal with this. I didn’t want to have all this stress. This has been the most eventful thing in my life, and I don’t even know where to go next on how to deal with it. What’s going to happen when I tell my parents? They won’t abuse me, because I’m telling them with my therapist in the room when it happens, which will be today or tomorrow, but they might when I get home… I’m really scared. \n\nThe picture is the bracelet I had to wear when I was at the hospital. I’m keeping it as a reminder about the struggles I’ve gone through.","image_permalink":"http://generic-url123.tumblr.com/image/97302201720","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":956,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":669,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":536,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":335,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":134,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":956,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e09869ad531eca01190e70c3d1c8653a/tumblr_nbsle6X93N1r0vn52o1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"j-0-n-4-5","id":97302191987,"post_url":"http://j-0-n-4-5.tumblr.com/post/97302191987/its-jeans-day-today-and-i-pass-really-well-so-im","slug":"its-jeans-day-today-and-i-pass-really-well-so-im","type":"text","date":"2014-09-12 14:25:05 GMT","timestamp":1410531905,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"q0yT4bXE","tags":["trans","transgender","happy","goodtimes","passing","transguy","transboy","boi"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z0ZMWw1QdgPzp","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"title":"","body":"Its jeans day today and I pass really well so Im in a good mood.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"t3hsiggy","id":97302186715,"post_url":"http://t3hsiggy.tumblr.com/post/97302186715/i-couldnt-get-a-good-selfie-so-have-a-wacky-wild","slug":"i-couldnt-get-a-good-selfie-so-have-a-wacky-wild","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-12 14:24:59 GMT","timestamp":1410531899,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"h39vZQRB","tags":["me","gif","trans","dmab","mtf"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZkzuUy1QdgOhR","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":29,"caption":"I couldn’t get a good selfie, so have a wacky wild inflatable tube Amy instead","image_permalink":"http://t3hsiggy.tumblr.com/image/97302186715","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":360,"height":480,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2e7d1d15014f689d30ada408c76cf51a/tumblr_nbsldnz6qH1qa80wlo1_400.gif"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2e7d1d15014f689d30ada408c76cf51a/tumblr_nbsldnz6qH1qa80wlo1_250.gif"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2e7d1d15014f689d30ada408c76cf51a/tumblr_nbsldnz6qH1qa80wlo1_100.gif"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2e7d1d15014f689d30ada408c76cf51a/tumblr_nbsldnz6qH1qa80wlo1_75sq.gif"}],"original_size":{"width":360,"height":480,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2e7d1d15014f689d30ada408c76cf51a/tumblr_nbsldnz6qH1qa80wlo1_400.gif"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"feministroosterteeth","id":97301581126,"post_url":"http://feministroosterteeth.tumblr.com/post/97301581126/i-remember-seeing-some-trans-people-identifying-their","slug":"i-remember-seeing-some-trans-people-identifying-their","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-12 14:12:42 GMT","timestamp":1410531162,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"qxePInDN","tags":["Anonymous","trans","transgender","mandrogynous","mandrogyny","cissexism","transphobia","frtasks"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZHQdjr1Qde4r6","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"I remember seeing some trans people identifying their gender expression as \"mandrogynous\"? \"Andro\" already means male!!

I realized last night that I’ve been feeling my chest recently, as if to make sure that they’re not still there, that my body is no longer a prison. I love the feeling of fabric against my skin! A breeze blew against my shirt yesterday and I realized that I haven’t felt the sensation in a long time. It was new, almost like I’d never felt it before, like it was far away before and now it’s mine. I can’t wait until it heals more and the scars fade more, they look amazing now though. I feel so beautiful.\n\n I have been having a hard time with my belly recently. My whole body has changed because I wore the long compression top from Underworks (as well as a tri-top over it) and my tummy was compressed as well. Now, nothing is compressed and my belly is a brand NEW thing. My whole torso has changed drastically, not just my chest itself. It’s hard but I am working on loving it because I am beautiful and I need to remember that I feel like this at times when I feel like this is untrue.\n\n My body is my home and no longer my prison, I love my chest and loving my chub belly will come in time. I feel beautiful, my home is beautiful.

Just dead ends. \n\nI feel happy, and try to be, because that’s the only way I can cope. I’m sick of only being happy for other people’s progress.

the last couple of years, I have been following many different people on YouTube going through their transition, whether it being female to male, or male to female. I can honestly say I find it to be so heart warming. The way their face lights up to finally say that they will be starting hormones/testosterone. That they will finally physically become the person they always were inside. Even if it takes a long time, they’re willing to wait as long as it takes because dealing with the body dysforia is torture and to be a man/woman physically is what they’ve always wanted. \n\nWhat breaks my heart is to hear that when some of these people come out to their families and tell them that they are transgender, they are practically shown the door. They get kicked out or even abused at home because they aren’t considered normal or because their family thinks they can beat the nonsense out of them. But they can’t. Its not possible. I dont understand how a mother and father could show their own child the door because they want to be what they are on the inside. Just because one is born with the parts if a female does not mean they are mentally a female or vise versa.\n\nBut honestly, what I find to be the worst is when families tell their child that “its only just a phase, you’ll get out of it” because its not. You might not know when youre a young that you are indeed transgender but you just somehow know deep down that youre different from everyone else and that’s all that matters at the time. It takes a while for most to realize who they truly are. Its not just a phase, its who you are and who you will always be.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sensible-tips","id":97276576292,"post_url":"http://sensible-tips.tumblr.com/post/97276576292/crafty-times","slug":"crafty-times","type":"link","date":"2014-09-12 04:00:32 GMT","timestamp":1410494432,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"jB4S7B15","tags":["Frugal Friday","sensible-tips","FTM","trans","trans*","transgender","transmasculine","DIY","DIY FTM","DIY binder","DIY packer","DIY harness","DIY packer harness","how to"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZqIYWw1Qc8i8a","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"title":"Crafty Times","url":"http://www.imakeftmthings.tumblr.com","link_image":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_nbe2vzNvGp1r6klsp_og.png","description":"A place to showcase DIY transmasculine and FTM crafts.

We talked about how long I’ve known I was trans, what I hope to achieve, why I want to transition etc. She was so amazing. Dr. Eckler truly, genuinely cares for people. She has a refreshing interest in improving the quality of healthcare and life for trans individuals. \n\nSo we talked about testosterone and the effects and all that medical stuff, and then to my surprise, she told me that she’d order my blood work and have me starting testosterone in the next couple of weeks. \n\nI have to say that I wasn’t expecting to be able to start so soon. I’m feeling a million different emotions about finally embarking on the journey. I have to admit that i am scared, but that fear cannot be compared to my optimism and excitement about being alive, and able to change the things I dislike about my life.\n\nI can’t wait to delve deeper into transitioning and will be talking about my journey on here!","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"wetalked-youpooped","id":97271494956,"post_url":"http://wetalked-youpooped.tumblr.com/post/97271494956/in-srs-need-of-snuggles","slug":"in-srs-need-of-snuggles","type":"text","date":"2014-09-12 02:50:33 GMT","timestamp":1410490233,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"t7VkWDM9","tags":["help","trans","wow"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZkOCWy1QbrJai","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"in srs need of snuggles","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sexydavekitty69","id":97271038276,"post_url":"http://sexydavekitty69.tumblr.com/post/97271038276/im-feeling-more-comfortable-going-outside-looking","slug":"im-feeling-more-comfortable-going-outside-looking","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-12 02:44:41 GMT","timestamp":1410489881,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"9maBLpBh","tags":["trans","trans boy","trans guy","trans male","trans man","ftm","ftm transgender","transgender","LGBT Rights","lgbt","lgbtq"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZB9vXn1Qbpa54","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"I’m feeling more comfortable going outside looking like a boy.

Students are totally cool with my transition. A few jerks refuse to use my correct pronouns, but like who cares about those lames. Bathrooms have gone extremely smooth.

I am so thankful that I have taken my first baby steps toward loving myself after all these years, and this is my first pebble I’d like to toss, to get the ripple effect going, one which says this: I am beautiful, and proud to be me.\n\nI will begin by saying this: I have been diagnosed with a few things out of my control, but not necessarily things that define me or my attitude. There are things I haven’t been diagnosed for, things I will come to accept or change about myself, once I come to terms with whether or not it’s a part of me that’s good for me.\n\nI was diagnosed first with a blood disorder, then bipolar II, then I made the biggest step forward in my life that has changed my life for so many good reasons: I told the truth about myself. I am a transgender guy. I was born with a female body, with everything else about me screaming YOU ARE MALE.\n\nFor years I thought the major part of my depression stemmed from my poor body esteem. For years I tried to cope and find me.\n\nMy poor body image, however, came long before I came out. I had been a few pounds underweight for a good portion of my life, but I still hated the small stomach I had. I never wore flattering clothes, and always tried to hide my body.\n\nI thought surgery would change this, as though eliminating the parts of me I was unhappy about would suddenly bring about a miraculous era of love for myself. Instead I was greeted with the side effects of medication and surgery: keloids and weight gain. The perfect chest I’d always dreamed of came with drawbacks, the scars will never heal and they caused 18 months of physical pain before I could finally afford help in terms of dermatology.\n\nI have had binge eating problems (where I eat, and feel guilty about it later, or “I eat my emotions.”) and now I am finally facing those issues because they are finally visible. Now I have stretch marks everywhere. Knees, thighs, back, stomach, arms, chest, you name it. My body image and self-esteem are at the lowest point they have ever been, and having the doctors tell me I need to lose weight repeatedly has never helped, or motivated me. Because of my chronic depression, I feel even less motivation to get around to “feeling better about me.” There was a time in my life where I absolutely thought I couldn’t take it anymore, and a year later I wound up checking myself into a hospital to prevent myself from taking my own life.\n\nYou know what though? I’m proud that I did that. I would not become the amazing person I am today if I had given in. And I’m proud that I admitted I needed help. Everyone thinks that if you go to a hospital for “mental issues,” you are crazy. I actually remember, however, this five day experience as one of the happiest times of my life. I learned that there was nothing wrong with me, I am beautiful the way I am. My second problem was that I didn’t love or accept the people around me, and that I couldn’t see that I am strong, wise, inspirational, and brave.\n\nI am still working on my self-esteem as I’ve said, but I want to truly love me, and part of me is loving and accepting this vessel I was given. You only get one, as they say. Part of loving me means loving who I am and what makes me the wonderful person I am.\n\nI want you to know above all, there are people like you out there. There are people whose surgeries didn’t give them the body of a god/goddess. There are people out there just like you who struggle just like you. I am one of these people. And I don’t care who you are or what your situation is.\n\nYOU. ARE. BEAUTIFUL, and I love you. Never let anyone make you feel/tell you otherwise.\n\nI am willing to listen if you ever need to talk, and also willing to make friends here.\n\nMy blog is: fullmetalchampion\n\nfullmetalchampion.tumblr.com\n\n  BE BRAVE!

He acknowledged and apologized for past slights and behaviors at the heart of a significant gap between HRC and the trans community in the hopes that fences can finally be mended. Just as important, he pledged that the organization would do better in the future.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this for a few days now, letting it seep in and settle in my consciousness. What happened in 2007, when then-HRC president Joe Solmonese stood on that very same stage making promises and commitments that would prove to be inconvenient and hollow less than six weeks later, continues to be a dagger between the shoulders for many of us who dared to believe back then. Perhaps nobody felt that pain more acutely than I.\n\nAt the time I was the first and only trans member of the HRC board of directors. I was the cochair of the diversity committee. Jamison Green and I worked tirelessly for the business council, and many of the workplace protections and benefits that have become such an important reality for many trans people today are a direct result of the work that we started. As a board member, I raised a significant amount of money to fund the critical work we were doing, and I spoke passionately and tirelessly at dinners around the country. I rolled up my sleeves and wasn’t afraid to fight on the front lines wherever and whenever necessary. Why? Because I believed. I trusted that the organization would stay true to the lofty ideals I thought we represented. When it proved that it didn’t, I had to go.\n\nKnowing what I know of the backstory of what happened, all I can say is that my sense of betrayal, anger, hurt, and frustration continues to this day. Time has dulled some of it, but the scab has still not healed. I realize we all need to put the past behind us in order to move forward, and I’m trying my best to do that, I really am. What happened was deeply, deeply personal, and there has still been no closure for me. But that’s water under the bridge at this point, and none of that is Chad’s fault.\n\nAlthough Chad stood on that stage and apologized last week, the truth is that he fell on a sword that wasn’t his to fall on. It was drawn by leaders in the organization who are no longer there and who I can say without hesitation were directly responsible for what unfolded and how. Chad inherited their ill-conceived legacy of anger and distrust, and has pledged to fix it. I respect him for that.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that HRC today is not the same organization it was then. At the same time, the collective trans community (and entire LGBT community, for that matter) has changed too. We have matured. We have weathered tests that strained the bonds of “community” and challenged our collective commitment to the high ideals I spoke of in my resignation letter. Whether we realize it or not, we have emerged the stronger for it.\n\nI have never met Chad Griffin, so I have no personal sense of his commitment to his words or his ability to keep his promises. Although I give him the benefit of the doubt, I hope to meet with him at some point to form my own opinion, as I trust my instincts. However, he’s off to a good start. The organization that he leads is already light-years ahead of where it was when I first got involved more than a decade ago. People I admire and respect greatly who left the organization around the “dark time” are back in leadership positions. Jay Brown, the director of foundation program strategies, is someone I’d stand with in battle any time, anywhere. Brandon Braud again leads the initiatives involving historically black colleges and universities with passion and skill. I met Hayden Mora, the deputy chief of staff, at Southern Comfort and came away impressed and hopeful. Internally, the organization has revamped and realigned its foundation structure to address the issues that affect the daily lives of many LGBT people.\n\nCan the organization do more? Of course it can. Per Chad’s speech, he recognizes that, and he pledged to address it through action. I have several nuggets of constructive personal advice for him. Let us help you keep the commitments that you made Friday. Don’t think you are doing things for us — do them with us. Actively reach out and engage those of us who may not have sipped the Kool-Aid yet, and take what we tell you seriously. Ask us what we need and what our priorities are; don’t presume to tell us. Don’t patronize us or placate us — it will only make us angry. Lead through example. Respect us, include us, embrace us, but most important of all, for God’s sake, realize that honesty and integrity must be nonnegotiable if this relationship is going to work. Without that, there is nothing.\n\nI want to believe that things are different now. I really do. It’s not that I’m a glutton for punishment. Rather, I consider myself a pragmatist first and foremost. We need to make this relationship work, not simply for the sake of the T but for the sake of all who define themselves by some letter of our continually growing LGBTQ+ alphabet soup. We’re either in this together or we’re not. Anything gained for some at the expense of others will ultimately prove itself to be a hollow victory for all. Been there, done that.\n\nErnest Hemingway once said, “The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.” Based on Chad’s comments last week, all I can promise in return is to do my best to try. Let’s start with that and see where it goes. If enough of us feel similarly — well, I dare to dream.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"massagemybellyfat","id":97262630739,"post_url":"http://massagemybellyfat.tumblr.com/post/97262630739/im-thinking-about-the-name-maddock-nickname-mac","slug":"im-thinking-about-the-name-maddock-nickname-mac","type":"text","date":"2014-09-12 00:57:37 GMT","timestamp":1410483457,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"2liLkgQr","tags":["trans","ftm","renaming myself"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZFT-Wu1QbJVTJ","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"title":"","body":"I’m thinking about the name Maddock/ nickname Mac.

Dad,\n\n  Before I really begin writing this letter, I want to ask that you read the entire thing. Some things that I say here may be difficult to process, make you feel anxious, angry, hurt, or even scared. But I’m not writing this letter to make you feel those things. I’m writing this letter because I’ve struggled for a long time now to find the perfect way to tell you what it is that I need to tell you, and this is the best way I can think of that will both allow me the time I need to comprise all of my thoughts, and you the time to process what I’m going to tell you before you respond.\n\n  I am a transgender man. I have been living as male and as Ashton since December 4, 2013. I’m sure you may be wondering whether this is my way of fitting in with my friends, especially considering that my best friend, Jay, is also a trans man. Let me dispel that notion from the start. I have more non-trans friends than I do trans friends. I have never felt right in my body. I thought that coming out as gay would fix that, and in some ways, it did. It gave me access to the LGBT community, and I was able to find friends who were more like me. However, even after immersing myself in the LGBT community, I didn’t feel whole. I felt a rush of anxiety whenever I would shower or look at myself in the mirror, whenever I would shop in the women’s section for my clothes, whenever I would even hear the words “she” or “her” in reference to me, and for a long time, I didn’t know where that anxiety was coming from or what it meant.\n\n  When I came to Wayne State, I met my first trans man – my good friend, Charlie. However, because he was already out as trans and living as male when I met him, it didn’t ever occur to me that I might actually be transgender – it never occurred to me that trans was something I could “be” (I put “be” in quotes there because being transgender is not something that one chooses to do…it is something one IS). Then, I met Jay. When I met Jay, he wasn’t out as trans. It was almost 6 months into our friendship before he told me that he had always felt like a male, and that he was going to start transitioning. That was the first time I realized that I might actually be trans, but I was far too terrified to even admit it to myself, let alone to anybody else. I spent the next few years denying the feelings I was having. Whenever I would look in the mirror, whenever anybody would use feminine gender pronouns when talking about me, whenever I would introduce myself as a lesbian at the GLBTA Student Union Meetings, I would feel my gut tighten, and I would ignore that feeling of discomfort that comes hand in hand with lying to yourself.\n\n  Finally, on December 4 of 2013, I was able to say the words out loud. I told the members of the GLBTA Student Union that I was trans and that, from that point forward, I would like to be known as Ashton, and be referred to by male pronouns. Now, everyone from my friends to my therapist to the Dean of Students knows me as Ashton and refers to me by male pronouns. I have never felt so happy and so complete as I have in the months since I’ve come out as trans. I have also felt an increased anxiety about having to hide this huge part of myself from my family, who literally mean the world to me. I told Amy about a month ago, but I promised her that I would wait to come out to the rest of the family until after her wedding. Part of me wanted to make sure that I didn’t take any attention away from her on her day, because she deserved to have her moment in the spotlight. However, part of me felt that if I had come out in the chaos preceding Amy’s wedding, I would be more likely to get a negative reaction, and that terrified me. Even as I write this letter, I am more scared than I can possibly express that I will lose what means more to me than anything – my family – by telling you this. Believe me, if this weren’t literally a matter of life and death for me – and it is – I would not transition. It would be much easier for me to exist within our family as a gay female than as a trans male. But the thought of living a lie causes me so much anxiety, and puts me in such a deep depression, that I am actually afraid of what I might do to myself if I continue to hide from this.\n\n  I am hoping to start taking testosterone soon, so you will start to see some physical changes, including deepening of the voice, increased hair growth, and a general change in body shape (due largely to a redistribution of body fat). I realize this will be a lot to take in, and that it may be difficult to see me looking like a completely different person. I also realize that you may be afraid that I am going to have a more difficult life because of my trans identity. This may indeed be the case. I am not coming out because I think it’s going to make my life perfect. I am also not coming out so that I can get your blessing – I am well aware that this is going to be incredibly difficult for you to accept, and that you only have my best interest at heart when you feel inclined to oppose my transition. I am coming out because I feel that I have no other choice if I am to live a full, happy life. \n\nI am truly sorry for any heartache this likely causes you. Please know that it causes me just as much heartache to know that I have to run the risk of losing my family in order to be true to myself. If it would help you, I would love to set up a session with my therapist – we could speak either over the phone or via Skype (I can easily explain to you how it works, so don’t worry about not knowing how to use it). If you feel that you would be uncomfortable with that, please know that I am always open to answer any questions you may have about this. I also have several resources that may help you to understand both what I am going through and how you can navigate it as my parents. I want you to be informed, but I didn’t include any of the resources I have available to me here because I don’t want you to feel as though I am forcing any of it down your throat – I want to be sure that it is information you are seeking on your own.\n\nPlease know that I love you, and that without you in my life, I would be lost.\n\nWith love,\n\nAshton","can_reply":false}]

Your body and gender is a beautiful part of you!”\n\nMe: “I want to love my vagina Fem, but right now there’s about 30 women with their hands all up in it and not in a sexy way. I’m mostly just trying to deal with that right now.”\n\nSo today in class we talked about Twilight and every single woman who spoke up in class, except my teacher, talked about how they want a man to protect them and all that stuff. The general consensus seemed to be that all other women feel that way as well.\n\nI wish I could say I proved them wrong but I couldn’t speak through the rage bubbling up in my chest. At that moment I was so aware of how alone I was. A woman with rage issues. An woman who is a loner. A singe Bi woman not looking for romance, marriage, or kids ever. A woman who has never dreamed a Cinderella dream of prince charming. A woman who wants to be prince charming.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nI went out behind the gym after class and kicked the wall till I felt better. It’s things like this that make me never want to talk to women I don’t know. It’s things like this that make me wish I weren’t a woman. I’ve never had a sexist comment from a male class mate or teacher, never. I know it happens but not to me. Most conversations I have with women have one or two.\n\nWhat can I make of this? Am I not a woman? Is there a place for me in my assigned gender group? I feel like Ive been told so many times “You’re not welcome here. Go elsewhere.” Where am I supposed to go?\n\nAre there women like me? Butch, strong, passionate, intelligent, determined women who don’t define themselves completely by childbirth and sex?\n\nThey say no one is an island but right now I sure feel like one.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"0sc4r","id":97259501785,"post_url":"http://0sc4r.tumblr.com/post/97259501785/throwback-i-guess-x","slug":"throwback-i-guess-x","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-12 00:15:44 GMT","timestamp":1410480944,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"rvyjWxEw","tags":["they/them","personal","queer","femme","trans","nonbinary femme"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZzTRJy1Qb7ZZP","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":12,"caption":"throwback i guess!\n\nx","image_permalink":"http://0sc4r.tumblr.com/image/97259501785","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":642,"height":960,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":748,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":598,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":374,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":150,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":642,"height":960,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/18a480ab8b27a9cfc733315a4e74f465/tumblr_nbri28soTF1qc0rewo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"princeofbellehair","id":97258755318,"post_url":"http://princeofbellehair.tumblr.com/post/97258755318/working-on-my-body-positivity","slug":"working-on-my-body-positivity","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-12 00:05:24 GMT","timestamp":1410480324,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"OYfdhVMc","tags":["body positive","trying","One day at a time","dysphoric","trans","ftm","self","queer"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z1WB6y1Qb4jJs","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":14,"caption":"Working on my body positivity","image_permalink":"http://princeofbellehair.tumblr.com/image/97258755318","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_1280.jpg"},{"width":422,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_500.jpg"},{"width":338,"height":600,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_400.jpg"},{"width":225,"height":400,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":178,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6cc8c3a1b5297279a0c30e24a0a82399/tumblr_nbrhl1EO6Q1qe2heso1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"popculturecatchall","id":97258655108,"post_url":"http://popculturecatchall.tumblr.com/post/97258655108/ive-been-working-on-my-voice-when-i-remember-in","slug":"ive-been-working-on-my-voice-when-i-remember-in","type":"text","date":"2014-09-12 00:04:01 GMT","timestamp":1410480241,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"yhiC0Ju7","tags":["trans","transgender","affectation","presentation","trans women","i had a metaphor i wanted to work in but it didn't fit within the flow so i left it out","for another time i guess"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z-CYhu1Qb4Ks4","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"I’ve been working on my voice, when I remember, in my car. I sit there for the thirty minutes or so of my commute and talk to myself. In fact, a sort of first draft, an oral version, of what I’m about to write came from today’s monologue.\n\nIt’s feels very strange and I feel very silly talking to myself the whole way home. When I pull up to a stoplight, or the traffic slows so that people can see clearly into my car, I stop talking and go into my pod people routine—you know, emotionless so no one suspects you haven’t been taken. All of this is enough to make it difficult to even practice. But it’s not really the most difficult part. I mean, who really gives a fuck if some stranger sees me talking to myself? Besides, they probably just think I have a phone on speaker or am a weirdo—either of which is fine.\n\nNo, the difficult part is hearing myself. Not because it’s bad, though sometimes it is. Mostly I can do a pretty good female sounding voice. I’ve always had a knack for altering my speech patterns and accents and impersonations—too much time watching SNL growing up or something. I can do a girl voice. And a lot of times it sounds natural and good and exactly how I desire (basically equally adept at talking about postmodern fiction and some dumb reality show on MTV).\n\nBut it is not me. Not yet. It is an affectation. A put on. An act. And sure, that’s to be expected. With practice it should become easier and more natural. And really what the fuck, right. I mean, of course it is an affectation—I need to affect this voice before I can have this voice. I’m not going to wake up sounding how I want tomorrow (though that would lead to some questions for my students if I did).\n\nSo why was I so hung up on this? Why was I so ashamed by the simple fact that I was trying? Red Durkin had a great post on this the other day too, about actively trying to not do things that would be construed as trying to pass and just the messed up head space you’re in when you try to navigate all this. It’s all this internalized transmisogyny and how it leads to these totally skewed thought processes. If I am trying to be a woman then I am not really a woman because women don’t have to try to be women, you think yourself into a corner.\n\nI bought a sports bra, a dress, and a belt a few weeks back. I don’t need any of them yet. The sports bra is sort of hedging against getting lucky early on and needing to hide a couple things in my male presentation. The others were a treat. I wanted girl clothes. I wanted clothes for me, because I felt fucking shitty with the coming school year and looking for shirts that were just another fucking reminder that every damn day starts with a lie to the world. But even though I don’t own any underwear, I bought the dress and the belt. Even though I wouldn’t have anything to put under it, I bought the dress. I bought it first because I felt strange as I thought about buying underwear. I couldn’t do it. It’s such a tired fucking cliche, the women’s underwear. And it felt like a confirmation of all the shitty stuff people say about trans women, that we’re just doing it for the thrills, that I needed to actively avoid it even though ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WILL KNOW WHAT I AM BUYING! And here’s a thing: women buy underwear every fucking day. It’s one of those things that literally everyone needs to do.\n\nI could buy the sports bra, because that I could legitimize in my mind as being utilitarian. It serves a purpose. I may need it in order to continue to look male.\n\nReread that last sentence. That one is the key here.\n\nMy everyday voice, my masculine voice, is a total fucking affectation. It is one that was gained through hours and hours of practice. Just in this case it was all unconscious. It was steered there by all the expectations and pressures that come with wanting to not be read as trans. It is just as constructed as my fem voice will be. Even what my voice is shifts throughout the day—as a teacher who talks in front of crowds a lot, I actively consider my voice and alter my speaking patterns all the fucking time. But when I don’t challenge the masculine assumption, when I don’t invite the criticism of the patriarchal response to a fem voice that resides in my own head, then it is assumed to be “authentic” or “natural.”\n\nIt is all presentation and it is all authentic. But when we look at how women affect their presentation suddenly it becomes artificial. We roundly criticize the use of make-up in our culture—think of all the stupid shit people say about liking a girl who doesn’t wear make-up—as being false. We value the honesty of a “natural” look. We also criticize those who reject this. Every paparazzi photo of a women without make-up ought to just read “What will the menz think when they see your face!” Women must present themselves for the male gaze, but still maintain the respectable standards men set. And of course make-up is for men, as every makeover special reminds us—however will you find a man if you don’t look pretty! Make-up couldn’t be for self-expression, or to attract women, or to feel confident in yourself. All these same little thoughts can be put there for voice, dress, whatever. And we could extend the logic along the axis of race instead of gender and see how the culture paints people of color as putting more effort into their appearance than white people. The dominant structure claims it is real and authentic and therefore all others should act either in aspiration or response. But that’s bullshit. It’s all a fucking act, and it’s all real.\n\nAnd by all, I mean all. That includes the slob dudes in their ratty t-shirts. That is an affectation—they are telling the world exactly what they do and do not care for. My brother was telling me once how he liked shopping at Costco because there’s no design, it’s barebones and because of that he knew their full focus was on just getting the job done. The Costco, in other words, was dressed like him. Plain jeans and a t-shirt, just going to work. It’s not as if Costco could have contemplated the look of their stores and considered the effect of design and decided that this exact look would convey the exact message my brother received. No, design was an unnecessary detail only. Ornamentation. All that frilly crap. But that’s a false dichotomy. It’s all design, and it is all an act. Sometimes it’s conscious, as with my voice, and sometimes it’s unconscious, as with my brother’s jeans and tee look.\n\nSo fuck those who tell you you are anything but real or try to tell you how you are unnatural. We are all natural and real and fake and artificial in equal measure. Trans women have just as much right to try on a look or a voice or anything as anyone else. Giving effort is not a sign of a lack of substance. It does not compromise our identity.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"anemicroyaltee","id":97258321912,"post_url":"http://anemicroyaltee.tumblr.com/post/97258321912/tomorrow-i-think-im-going-to-wear-my-lgbt-pride","slug":"tomorrow-i-think-im-going-to-wear-my-lgbt-pride","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 23:59:31 GMT","timestamp":1410479971,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"xd9nIzvA","tags":["lgbt","lgbt pride","gay","trans","transsexual"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZbrnCt1Qb33Vu","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"title":"","body":"tomorrow i think im going to wear my LGBT pride shirt as a way of SLOWLY coming out. i hope no one says anything negative.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"lgbtqblogs","id":97258300659,"post_url":"http://lgbtqblogs.tumblr.com/post/97258300659/we-need-a-national-conversation-about","slug":"we-need-a-national-conversation-about","type":"quote","date":"2014-09-11 23:59:12 GMT","timestamp":1410479952,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"L3HnTJBH","tags":["trans","transgender","trans*","lgbtq","lgbtq news","lgbt","lgbtq current events","lgbtqia"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZBCnOy1Qb2_Jp","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":153,"text":"We need a national conversation about transphobia, which dehumanizes, demeans and disadvantages a specific group of people.

I don’t really have an answer for how to make it better, although one major thing that has helped me is just paying attention to other guys and realizing that there isn’t one set standard for masculinity. Yeah, I might cross my legs in a way that I feel is too feminine, but there are also plenty of other guys out there who cross their legs that way (or gesture when they talk, or call things “adorable,” or whatever). Some of it is just self-acceptance. I’ve kind of come to terms with the fact that I’m not a super masculine guy and I’ll probably never be one. This self-policing is pretty common, though, I think. We feel like we need to prove/justify our genders to the rest of the world, and even to ourselves. Ideally, though, we should just be able to be ourselves without having to worry about it.\n\nTrans guys aren’t the only ones carefully policing their genders and worrying about this stuff, I’ve met plenty of cis guys who are also concerned about coming off as too feminine. It’s practically an epidemic. So, I’d say try to find a way to accept the more feminine things about yourself and relax about it.

When you have trans men, a population marginalised both for being trans and for having experienced a semi-marginalised status from their assignment at birth, the shocking incidence of misogyny, transmisogyny, MRA-esque bullshittery, “truscummery”, a much higher rate of heterosexuality than trans women3 (55% versus 27%) – which is, especially male heterosexuality, a patriarchal institution – and general chauvinistic grotesqueness, I can’t help but start to question this state of affairs. What’s causing this? Bigotry is so much more endemic in trans men’s communities than should be expected of similarly marginalised groups. There’s definitely something going on, and I’m not intellectually lazy enough to presume mere accident.\n\nJust like there’s no such thing as a non-exploitative bourgeoisie, there’s no such thing as a non-sexist man, so how exactly do you sit down and think about gender then reach the conclusion that misogyny and exploiting women is the thing for you? Trans maleness, by definition, means overt identification with manhood and the decision to join the ranks of the patriarchs. The political and social signals that “moving into manhood” sends are not desirable at all. Having been on the receiving end of manhood from birth, cis men aren’t moving into it like trans men are, and are maybe not by necessity as active a participant in maleness as them.\n\nThe trans men who feel bodily dysphoria should absolutely and in no way be denied any opportunity to get that fixed (I understand that pain all too well), but critical self-examination is still required, manhood is still fundamentally and irredeemably a reactionary identity and social position. Does fixing bodily dysphoria require active identification with maleness? I don’t think so, and I don’t think that someone wanting to move into that space should be entirely trusted either.\n\nIt’s highly hypocritical on the part of trans activists to at once state that social conditions (transphobia, transmisogyny) are a deterrent to transition, but in the same breath say that social conditions (male privilege, for trans men) aren’t an incentive to transition. Trans men, upon transition, get a pay rise,4 after all.\n\nThe only progressive way forward is for men – cis and trans alike – to strive to give up manhood, to abdicate their patriarchal throne. To consciously decide to fight sexism at every opportunity and to disassociate as much as possible from their privileged position, masculinity, and exploitation of women. To try and undermine their own social position at every turn. Progressive men should stop trying to envision a “better” manhood or a “better” masculinity; men hurt themselves, other men, women, and non-men when they assert their masculinity, and they should stop trying to imagine ways to redeem themselves without fundamental change.\n\nJust like I strive to give up and end my position and the category of first world labour aristocrat, my position of whiteness, and my position of physical abledness, I call on men to strive to give up manhood. It doesn’t mean I shrug off the label “white” or “labour aristocrat”, just the positioning of those identities as good, or at worst neutral. It means that I recognise that they are fundamentally oppressive social positions and that the only possible use for them are as political organising labels and for the recognition of my own privilege.\n\nThe call for the abolishment of gender isn’t quite correct, or at least requires a bit more nuance and elaboration. Women and men are not the problem, to be abolished on equal terms, it’s men who are the main problem. That’s where we need to focus our energy. You don’t abolish classes by trying to abolish the proletariat and the bourgeoisie both together, no, you focus on the bourgeoisie. You focus on the exploiters and the dominant class in the dialectic – you abolish men first and foremost.\n\nWomanhood\n\nWomanhood and manhood are defined by their existence through each other and their violent struggle against one another. You can’t have one without the other, a contradiction (and an antagonistic one at that) in dialectics parlance. One is the struggle of the oppressed and one the struggle of the oppressor. It’s for this reason that a trans woman identifying with womanhood is fundamentally different from a trans man identifying with manhood. One is the reflexive cry of the downtrodden, and the other can be an angry request to be let into the exploiter clubhouse.\n\nWhen I say “I’m a woman” I’m not saying I innately “feel like a woman” (I don’t think you can ever construct a non-patirarchal justification for that), I’m instead relating myself to other women and our shared experience as a class under patriarchy. I’m stating that my material interests and experience of the world are aligned with womanhood; my liberation is therefore fundamentally and intimately bound up with other women, and thus as far as I’m concerned, “woman” describes me.\n\nI “identify” with womanhood because it describes my political experience. It’s the category, or near enough (“genderfreakhood” is also pertinent), that is imposed on me. Like the other oppressive social constructs – blackness or queerness for example – identification with them isn’t reification, but a recognition of the political and social reality of other’s reification of the concept.\n\nMy birth designation doesn’t matter. When I’m walking down the street, people gender me as “not male”, as a woman, and it makes me uneasy. When people spew biotruths or make sexist jokes, I know it’s aimed at me. When I see women objectified over and over and over again, I can’t help but learn to hate myself. When I hear about rampant rape, sexual assault, and general violence, I wonder, might I become one of those statistics? Even before I transitioned and started changing my body, the sexism I encountered was still generally aimed at people of a body type I needed for my health. Whenever I interact with a man there’s always a nagging in the back of my mind, how are gender relations coloring this interaction? Again and again, I constantly face misogyny – I face womanhood.\n\nIt’s for this reason there are little points of unity between trans men/some CAFAB gendequeers (those who benefit from transmisogyny) and trans women/those who face transmisgoyny. I have a lot more in common with cis women than I do the majority of trans men. When CAFAB trans people talk about their relationship to “trans” and “gender”, it’s quite often in a decidedly “non-political” or non-radical manner. This isn’t how I feel about being a woman, my womanhood is strictly political.\n\nFor many trans men their transness is some kind of “subversive” gender performance, some sort of flight of fancy (to put it perhaps a little crudely). They adopt “he/his” pronouns and change their haircut and clothing in a limited capacity, and then just go on with their lives, coming first in the oppression olympics, winning various book deals, getting a multitude of spoken word performance awards, and so on, all on the backs of trans women (mostly of color).","source":"Trans People and the Dialectics of Sex and Gender: Against Radical and Liberal Feminism","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"pagingmisspage","id":97250650553,"post_url":"http://pagingmisspage.tumblr.com/post/97250650553/at-a-car-dealership-up-in-ocala-shooting-a-spot","slug":"at-a-car-dealership-up-in-ocala-shooting-a-spot","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 22:14:33 GMT","timestamp":1410473673,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"1Hcs4M5X","tags":["transgender","trans","dmab","amab","maab","mtf","male to female","transition","daily life of a trans woman"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZP9ewn1Qabocv","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":7,"caption":"At a car dealership up in Ocala shooting a spot for a news business program.

things with transitioning","body":"So, as a newly transitioning trans-male, it’s starting to become more giddy to transition. I was never allowed to get men’s body wash or deodorant because my mother does not believe a ‘woman’ like me should be using it. Now that I, and my partner, have money, we’re able to buy me things that I’ve only wished I could get for a while.\n\nI’ve had such a desensitized feeling towards women’s clothing now because of how long I had to wear them. Even though I’m a taller biological female, and have large feet (Usually a size 11.5 in women’s, USA), my mother always went out of her way to buy me women’s sneakers and such. Now that I own my very own men’s sneakers and my own socks that I didn’t have to steal from my brothers… It’s honestly nice. You would never think a person would get so emotional or happy over getting a new pair of tennis shoes or a new wallet that actually fit who they feel like.\n\nBeing able to look at your face and see more of a man through your clothing and your accessories is a life saving feeling to me. After being able to throw away all those women’s clothing, it almost feels so surreal to be able to basically not wear any female clothing or have any female accessories anymore, but in a good way.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"prudence-lana","id":97249990273,"post_url":"http://prudence-lana.tumblr.com/post/97249990273/why-i-dont-need-surgery-to-be-transgender","slug":"why-i-dont-need-surgery-to-be-transgender","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 22:05:53 GMT","timestamp":1410473153,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"reSCYmp1","tags":["mtf","trans","transgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z03e6n1QaZHQ1","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"title":"Why I don't need surgery to be transgender.","body":"<!-- more -->\n\nIn the year 2000, a young boy puts on his clothes and eats his lunch. He is thinking hard about himself, something he’ll continue to do a lot in his life. The boy turns to his mom and says “Mommy, I want to be a girl.”\n\nThe mom, being a conservative Christian at that time, says it’s not possible. So the boy grows up to 15 before these feelings show themselves consciously again.\n\nThis boy notices that through his entire life, he’s always been girlish, from his personality right down to his slender curvy build. He notices that he’s always wanted to be “one of the girls” ever since he got friends in his old town.\n\nThe boy is long gone from the suburban town where he lived as a three year old. Now he is in a big city and his parents have converted from Christianity to Atheism. So this boy, after speaking with a very special friend about what being transgender is, begins to have the thought: “What if I’m just masquerading as a boy?”\n\nIn that moment, it dawned on her. She is a girl. She never expected it coming, but she could feel the glass defog and she saw herself clearly. This is what her identity was missing. This is why she felt incomplete before. Because she was born without the right equipment.\n\nHer friends and family were mainly supportive and she is extremely thankful for that. But one surgery she gets asked often is, “Are you going to get surgery?”\n\nNow, at first she dodged this question by saying she didn’t know. But she did heavily consider it. When she factored in all the money, time, and effort that this surgery would take, she knew that she would be completely happy with a penis.\n\nSome people tell her “You aren’t trans unless you are transitioning!” but they don’t understand that she is transitioning. Her identity as presented to other people is transitioning. The parent-son relationship she once had with her parents is changing into a parent-daughter one. Her life is transitioning from how she used to live, to how she truly wants to live.\n\nSo yes, she is transitioning everything except the physical aspects. And that’s her choice. It makes her no less of a woman than any other woman on Earth. She is an MtF transgender person.\n\nNow it’s 2014, and she is happily living as a girl. She has been fully accepted by her parents and all of her friends support her. A few still misgender or use her old name, but it happens so rarely (and almost always accidental) that she doesn’t even get upset anymore. She is finally secure with herself.\n\nI hope you have all learned something from my experience and have a lovely day~","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"birolesmantic","id":97249715521,"post_url":"http://birolesmantic.tumblr.com/post/97249715521/alex-queerture-zazzle-com-store","slug":"alex-queerture-zazzle-com-store","type":"link","date":"2014-09-11

I was really afraid of waking up to a permanent state of chest numbness. Fortunately, those fears turned out to be unfounded!\n\nMy nipples don’t become erect anymore but they can seriously feel everything! It definitely feels different but for me, it’s a better different! Before surgery, my nipple sensations felt awkward and not the least bit arousing.\n\nNow, I find nipple stimulation to be quite pleasurable. My nips are totally an erogenous zone. Most sensations are brain powered anyway. For example, people with paralysis still experience erections.

Every time I would see a guy’s chest that I had thought had come out particularly well they had always gone to him. So, it seemed an obvious choice once I found out he was only a couple hours from where I lived. How convenient is that?\n\nI’ve been spending the last fifteen months saving money for surgery, and at this point, I have about a third of it ready to go. That’s enough to at least book. To pick a date, and get myself prepared/save the rest of the money.\n\nBut for some reason, I haven’t made the call. I can’t really explain it. I don’t have a particular reason. I guess maybe there’s this part of me that just cannot imagine that I am about to spend this much money. I’m not really the type to buy big ticket items for myself. I see this price tag in my head as a new car, a down payment on a modest house, a way to invest in the future.\n\nI keep thinking, what if I hold out a little longer? Maybe I could get medical insurance that will cover my surgeries. Then, I start thinking about the process of waiting for that kind of approval, finding a new doctor, possibly ending up with horrible results. It’s a lot to reconsider on a timeline that may or may not even exist as a possibility. There’s no guarantee insurance will ever cover transgender surgeries.\n\nThere’s the picking a new doctor aspect of it to- I mean, who’s to even say I made the “right” choice, no one is flawless. Dr. G does great work, obviously, but there’s this part of me that knows I only get one shot at this. If something doesn’t heal quite right it doesn’t look like he’s much into revisions unless you’re ready to shell out another $8,000. But who’s stuff is better and within such a close distance to my current location? No one as far as I know.\n\nAs many concerns as I have regarding the surgery itself, anesthesia, pain, everything- overall, if it weren’t for the money this would already be done. So that line of thinking leaves me wondering- now that it looks like saving this money may be possible, what ultimately is keeping me from making this call? Why do I feel so guilty about doing something I know will make me a happier and more well-adjusted person?","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"bumpulp","id":97242796456,"post_url":"http://bumpulp.tumblr.com/post/97242796456/i-always-think-i-have-my-shit-so-figured-out-and","slug":"i-always-think-i-have-my-shit-so-figured-out-and","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 20:32:49 GMT","timestamp":1410467569,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"Gm1H41WV","tags":["i need help","what is self acceptance even","trans","help me","suicide tw","self harm tw","transgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zi2Mom1Qa7r6e","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"I always think I have my shit so figured out and I’m soo comfortable with who I am but i think actually\n\nI’ve just learned how to be comfortable being male and I never learned how to be comfortable with being trans and that might be like an important thing to do maybe but I don’t know how??\n\nbecause actually i’m still like how do i do the trans thing without killing/hurting myself???\n\nand like i’m pretty sure I dont want to kill myself buuut","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"atlasvertebra","id":97242549074,"post_url":"http://atlasvertebra.tumblr.com/post/97242549074/more-ugh-i-dunno-actually-blogging-makes-me","slug":"more-ugh-i-dunno-actually-blogging-makes-me","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 20:29:36 GMT","timestamp":1410467376,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"gfdePrqj","tags":["trans","dysphoria"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z-xiZm1Qa6ujI","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"<!-- more -->\n\nugh I dunno, actually blogging makes me feel a bit better, having somewhere to go with my love of the stuff I blog about and my trans and asperger’s feelings\n\nbecause, like….

I no longer had to face on-the-job discrimination and harassment if I didn’t want to,\" she explained. \"I could log-in and make money without people caring about what I look or sound like.\"\n\nHer experiences with Internet freelancing, as an Apple employee, and a stint in beauty school planted the seed for TransTech, which is now becoming a reality through help from an Indiegogo fundraiser.\n\n\"It is my mission to make TransTech the Apple of the nonprofit industry!\" Ross says.\n\nMore specifically, the project’s ultimate goal is to empower trans attendees to become self-employed independent contractors in the tech industry. Apprentices will accomplish this by practicing their skills in a training setting, similar to beauty school students. Customers will pay an affordable rate for web and graphic design, and apprentices will be able to earn income; any extra profit will be used by TransTech to continue the next cycle of apprenticeships.\n\nRoss says tht the program’s unique setup came to her after she began observing other employment programs in Chicago. “[They] were focusing heavily on training people for food service jobs or manual labor jobs,” she recalls. “The attitude was that tech skills would be over-the-heads of the populations typically served by social services. But I knew for a fact this wasn’t true, and I set out to prove it.”\n\nTech skills are, Ross believes, going to be increasingly in-demand in our tech-savvy world. She hopes TransTech will set its participants up for “economic improvement,” and help ease the “extreme levels of poverty, discrimination, harassment, and violence towards the trans community, especially trans women of color.”\n\nShe refers to this approach as “social enterprise:” the maximization of both individual and community well-being, rather than profit. In the video below, she beams with confidence at how needed a program like TransTech is at a time like this. Trans community advocates — including Trans*H4CK founder Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler, coder Naomi Ceder, and GLAAD Media Strategist Tiq Milan — have agreed, coming out on social media in vocal support of the nonprofit.\n\nRoss’ only lament so far, she says, is her inability to do more. “We have received roughly 30 applications and they are still pouring in; my email and phone are bombarded by hopeful apprentices,” she tells The Advocate. “But we can only afford to enroll 2 people [in the first session], which breaks my heart.”\n\n\"That’s why,\" she concludes, \"even though we are only looking to raise $15,000 to get us through the first 12-week apprenticeship, I am hoping the rest of the community understands how much of a difference TransTech can make in the lives of trans people and the LGBT community as a whole.\"\n\n\"The more money we raise, the more trans people we can enroll, pay, and set on the path to independence.\"","permalink_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAkIrmcgMoY","html5_capable":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MAkIrmcgMoY/hqdefault.jpg","thumbnail_width":480,"thumbnail_height":360,"player":[{"width":250,"embed_code":"<iframe

For most of his career, he experienced bias, but didn’t give much weight to it—seeing incidents as discrete events. (When he solved a tough math problem, for example, a professor said, “You must have had your boyfriend solve it.”) When he became Ben, however, he immediately noticed a difference in his everyday experience: “People who don’t know I am transgendered treat me with much more respect,” he says. He was more carefully listened to and his authority less frequently questioned. He stopped being interrupted in meetings. At one conference, another scientist said, “Ben gave a great seminar today—but then his work is so much better than his sister’s.” (The scientist didn’t know Ben and Barbara were the same person.) “This is why women are not breaking into academic jobs at any appreciable rate,” he wrote in response to Larry Summers’s famous gaffe implying women were less innately capable at the hard sciences. “Not childcare. Not family responsibilities,” he says. “I have had the thought a million times: I am taken more seriously.”","source":"Transgender People Can Explain Why Women Don’t Advance at Work | New Republic","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"potentialtransdyke","id":97238317005,"post_url":"http://potentialtransdyke.tumblr.com/post/97238317005/one-nice-thing-about-being-a-butch-trans-woman-is","slug":"one-nice-thing-about-being-a-butch-trans-woman-is","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 19:32:53 GMT","timestamp":1410463973,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"LCh6KtDB","tags":["butch trans woman","flannel shirts","flannel","trans woman","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZginAv1QZslVD","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"title":"","body":"One nice thing about being a butch trans woman is that it ex post facto rationalizes my eternal love for flannel shirts.

[…]\n\n We should be seeking to build the widest and deepest alliance possible. We need all perspectives represented, but first we need to stop pushing people out from under the transgender umbrella in the name of respectability politics.

Seems pretty nasty, doesn’t it?\n\nTrans people are not immune to this — and indeed, often when pushed, trans people will resort to all manner of reactions and arguments and justifications for this because they often are no more knowledgeable about this than anyone else.\n\nWhat that means, as well, is that this description has nothing whatsoever to do with biology, and therefore arguments about biology aren’t valid when contradicting it.\n\nIt would be akin to saying that the United States Army shouldn’t exist because of broccoli.\n\nThis all comes together in the core aspect here: like sexual orientation, this is part of what creates the sense of self in people, and it therefore is part of how they know that they exist as an individual human being, and is a part of that.\n\nSo the same question of how you know can be answered in as many different ways as there are people, and it is the still same way that those asking the question know what their social sex identity is.\n\nThis effectively makes it the trans version of the question “how do you know you are gay?”, with the same accurate answer of “I just do, because I know I exist.”\n\nThe answer may not satisfy those seeking some sort of concrete answer, but it is inevitable that they themselves will discount any answer because for them the same question remains unanswered in a way they would accept from a trans person, usually due to cis privilege.\n\nSo asking the question, especially in a venue such as Tumblr, is a form of logical fallacy and a trap, meant to defame and ridicule and provide justification for hate speech and violence against trans people.\n\n  This is especially a common tactic among transphobes, who can be identified using expressions described here.\n\nDO be sure to reference the links earlier in this post, as it is a part of the What is Series.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"princesshollycollie","id":97232391671,"post_url":"http://princesshollycollie.tumblr.com/post/97232391671/sweet-light-up-halloween-shirt-from-the-thrift","slug":"sweet-light-up-halloween-shirt-from-the-thrift","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 18:01:30 GMT","timestamp":1410458490,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"htrhXiVK","tags":["halloween","me","selfie","trans","trans girl"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZKOAcs1QZW8tt","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"caption":"Sweet light up Halloween shirt from the thrift store","image_permalink":"http://princesshollycollie.tumblr.com/image/97232391671","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/3ed92a34515c85530b6d6dce0d188246/tumblr_nbr0qiCcFV1sn0cjbo1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":"Samsung GT-P5210","ISO":100,"Aperture":"f/2.8","Exposure":"1/8th","FocalLength":"2mm"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"lontanoconlamente","id":97232390255,"post_url":"http://lontanoconlamente.tumblr.com/post/97232390255/parenti","slug":"parenti","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 18:01:28 GMT","timestamp":1410458488,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"lflkHrke","tags":["gay","etero","animal","trans","siamo tutti uguali","genitori di merda"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZuD_4u1QZW8Xl","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":7,"title":"parenti","body":"I miei genitori sono usciti fuori di testa.

I’m stuck in a binary mindset that I totally can’t seem to shake. It sucks because like I am totally not trying to be ignorant or hurtful. \n\nSince being out full time I have gotten the stares and the glares, but for the most part I don’t have confrontation or get misgendered… I know that I don’t have an ideal female figure coming from an hyper-masculine athletic guy being in the infantry, but I haven’t let that limit me in being me. It also helps that I was able to change my voice psychologically and it clearly passes as feminine. \n\nI still have to try to pull off male which I fail at for the army and I get gendered correctly (female) when I am trying to pull off an infantry soldier (only males) which in turn makes some people weird with me. \n\nI totally don’t know what I am ranting about anymore as I can was continually interrupted in making the post. *sigh*\n\nI guess I just wish that even though I know that the trans community is a minority in the public and in society that it wasn’t so feudal and butt hurt amongst itself as with others. Seeing things like die cis scum and transphobes or transphobia makes feel irksome amongst the community. I know that we aren’t accepted for the most part and that some of us come from cis privilege still expecting that privilege, but like sometimes you gotta just except what it is that you are giving up to be true to yourself. Like it sucks how many friends and how much family I have lost and it sucks that I continually have to face hardships not only within myself, but in public as being trans is hard, but like I don’t think that it is right to whine so hard that the world doesn’t accept you. Even if you were born cis most likely the world would seem like it is against you with every step that you take. Life is hard regardless. Trans just makes it even more harder, but once you free yourself from the constraints of everything that is holding you back you need to realize that is strength in itself. You might never truly pass, I might never fully pass, we all might never fully pass, but that is alright. As long as we live true to ourselves and try to be the best versions of ourselves we can make it in this world and we can be accepted by society. The first step is accepting ourselves and realizing that is who that matters at the end of the day. \n\nWith the current state that the trans community is at I fully believe that even though I am a part of it, I know that until it changes and becomes a source of power and support, that I don’t want to be involved with it because the backlash of trying to be proud for representing as trans in your own way seems to offend people who have different views or beliefs on what it means to be trans. In destroying the gender binary and realizing that there is many ways to being we have to realize that not everyone will look at how to be who they are the same way you are. \n\nI’m femme, I like girly things and try to live up to certain stereotypes. I am ok with that. I am ok with society the way it is. I am ok that I know I am going to have to fight for every inch that I can get in the world. I am ok with the fact that some people won’t accept me no matter how much I prove myself. I am ok with the fact that people will dismiss me because of my represented gender, race and that I am trans. I am ok with having to be different and I know that maybe I’ll stand out. I am still proud to be trans, but the same kind of proud that Jen Richards, Janet Mock or Laverne Cox represents. To me it is just a factor in my existence not a limiter. \n\nWe all limit ourselves from the world and from our true potential because we believe in can’t. I believe in can and I can do anything that I want. Yes, there is the scary factor that I will be targeted for hate because of my existence, but that goes for all people. We can die at any moment and have horrible things happen to us for no reason, but that is life and if that point is reached I want to know that I lived a proud life of who I am and aimed at who I want to be. \n\nThis is how I represent trans and I still have much to learn, but hopefully I am somewhere on the right track.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"princesshollycollie","id":97231378126,"post_url":"http://princesshollycollie.tumblr.com/post/97231378126/hello-2-everyone","slug":"hello-2-everyone","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 17:44:38 GMT","timestamp":1410457478,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"WZMo5mC5","tags":["me","selfie","trans","trans girl"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZKOAcs1QZSHRE","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":9,"caption":"Hello 2 everyone","image_permalink":"http://princesshollycollie.tumblr.com/image/97231378126","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":960,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":375,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":300,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":188,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":960,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/691710e3d907c584f1c78071aae3605f/tumblr_nbqzyeXZtF1sn0cjbo1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":"Samsung GT-P5210","ISO":100,"Aperture":"f/2.8","Exposure":"1/8th","FocalLength":"2mm"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"mothdot","id":97231297967,"post_url":"http://mothdot.tumblr.com/post/97231297967/getting-my-first-t-shot-tomorrow-last-day","slug":"getting-my-first-t-shot-tomorrow-last-day","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 17:43:19 GMT","timestamp":1410457399,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"E4fVBFi4","tags":["ftm","ftm transgender","trans","trans man","ftm pre-t","transition"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZG0lps1QZRzsl","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"title":"","body":"Getting my first t shot tomorrow.

This is no bad thing, in fact, this is quite a good thing. The other side of this, however, seems to be that the current generation of trans people, the ones in the 25-45 or so age bracket, often end up being ignored.\n\nBear in mind that throughout this post, I am speaking in generalisations. I know there are exceptions, and I know that not everyone will have experienced this, but I am speaking from my own experience, and it is not my intent to alienate anyone.\n\nExcluding places with incredibly large queer populations, like Brighton or London, it seems that support groups for trans people start with groups for youth and young adult ranges, serving people in age brackets like 15-18 or 16-25. And then you’ve got your groups for the older people in the community, who are dealing with the issues of transitioning later, or dealing with their transitions later on. Unfortunately, however, there’s rarely anything for the less older adults, leaving a gap in the market. A lot of the groups attended by the older generation don’t appear to have age brackets, but the fact is that these groups end up attracting those people, and often feel uncomfortable for the younger folks - who aren’t welcome at “youth” groups, because they’re too old - because their support needs are different. There also appears to be a feeling within the medical and general support communities that people in this age bracket do not need support or help, which is clearly wrong. This is apparent in mental health services, I feel it is mirrored within support for the trans community as well. The support needs for people does differ between the different age brackets, however the current method of “youth” and “everyone else” is not working.\n\nThis is mirrored in activism as well. If you look at the majority (again, generalising) of the big name trans activists, they’re all older folks. Activists from our age bracket just ended up being branded as “social justice warriors” or “attention hogs”. But then you move down in the age gap slightly, and queer media is raving about the teenagers and young adults who are standing up for themselves and changing the world around them. I do feel that this needs to be celebrated and promoted, but it needs to be done in a way that isn’t at the expense of other people who are fighting the same fights.\n\nI’m completely aware that nonbinary identities are “relatively new” in the public perception, that intersex people have often kept quiet and out of the spotlight, and that trans people who don’t transition generally hid it in the past, but the public is hearing about us now. But they’re not hearing about us from ourselves. They’re hearing about us from the perspectives of trans people who fit the “typical trans narrative”, the older trans activists, and generally in reference to the current generation of young trans people. And in many cases, these activists are acting in the role of allies, but they’re often speaking for us, not to us. Our voices are not being heard because trans activists will not leave a space for us to speak ourselves. There is an apparent “handover” going on, where we’re preparing to hand our fight from the older generation of big names to the younger, but in doing so, we’re skipping the people who are dealing with things right now. Just like the aforementioned support needs differ between the different ages within the trans community, so do the activism needs, and that’s not being addressed - no one has left a space for us, so we shout louder to make our own space. But then, instead of being activists, we’re “oversensitive”, “social justice warriors”, “loudmouths”, “whiny”, “attention seeking” or “just being difficult”. And it’s people within our community that are telling us these things as readily as the people outside our community.\n\nThe recent Stonewall situation, for example, where a handful of the big name activists were selected for the initial meeting with Stonewall about including the trans community at large - yes, in this instance, the attendees for the meeting were selected by Stonewall themselves with little consideration for the rest of the community. However, while several of the attendees were willing to speak to the rest of the community and find out how they felt about the issues, and what they wanted brought to the meeting on their behalf, there was no shortage of people who were just willing to tell us to get over it while they speak for us. And I believe a large part of this is either because of our age, or because of the fact that we’re not big-enough-name activists, which I also believe is related to our age.\n\nThis is a trend that needs to stop. We have voices, and they will be heard. We have needs that need support, and we will get it. The question is, does the trans community at large want to help, or do they want us to do it for ourselves? This is not dissimilar to the situation that the trans community as a whole has been in with LGB(“T”) activists for quite some time now, where they’ve left out trans people (again, both in support and activism) or spoken on their behalf - but are we going to improve it, or just repeat what’s happened to us before?","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"fromthecloudofowlyquill","id":97228014584,"post_url":"http://fromthecloudofowlyquill.tumblr.com/post/97228014584/boys-dont-spy-page-1-boys-dont-spy-page","slug":"boys-dont-spy-page-1-boys-dont-spy-page","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 16:47:00 GMT","timestamp":1410454020,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"xUCZI1ZC","tags":["transgender","transsexual","furry comic","trans","spy","spycraft","spying","spies","spy fiction","furry"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZMZtsr1QZFSFu","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"caption":"Boys Don’t Spy, Page 1.\nBoys Don’t Spy, Page 2.\nBoys Don’t Spy, Page 3.\nBoys Don’t Spy, Page 4.\nBoys Don’t Spy, Page 5.","image_permalink":"http://fromthecloudofowlyquill.tumblr.com/image/97228014584","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1000,"height":987,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":494,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":395,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":247,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":99,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1000,"height":987,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/015d63858c7fa6fe957e1c1590d41487/tumblr_nbqxangOLT1surt6ro1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sawyerthetransboy","id":97227883018,"post_url":"http://sawyerthetransboy.tumblr.com/post/97227883018/woodland-faerie-prince-is-applying-for","slug":"woodland-faerie-prince-is-applying-for","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 16:44:47 GMT","timestamp":1410453887,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"ULeZPA6S","tags":["nonbinary","genderqueer","trans","ftm","demiboy","femmeboy","faerie"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZIw2cn1QZEy8A","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":18,"caption":"Woodland faerie prince is applying for scholarships\n\nHe/him/his","image_permalink":"http://sawyerthetransboy.tumblr.com/image/97227883018","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":480,"height":640,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/88bfa4798361a40f1971b538bdbf8444/tumblr_nbqx6nc56R1tampsro1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/88bfa4798361a40f1971b538bdbf8444/tumblr_nbqx6nc56R1tampsro1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/88bfa4798361a40f1971b538bdbf8444/tumblr_nbqx6nc56R1tampsro1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/88bfa4798361a40f1971b538bdbf8444/tumblr_nbqx6nc56R1tampsro1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/88bfa4798361a40f1971b538bdbf8444/tumblr_nbqx6nc56R1tampsro1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":480,"height":640,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/88bfa4798361a40f1971b538bdbf8444/tumblr_nbqx6nc56R1tampsro1_500.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"idislikecispeople","id":97226938293,"post_url":"http://softcisphobia.co.vu/post/97226938293/hey-everyone-i-have-two-friends-who-live","slug":"hey-everyone-i-have-two-friends-who-live","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 16:27:00 GMT","timestamp":1410452820,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"AEkPTNES","tags":["trans","transgender","nonbinary","nb","enby","donations","signal boost","food tw"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z6gLrn1QZBLUr","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":56,"title":"","body":"Hey everyone, I have two friends who live together, their names are Jonathan and Elsa, Jonathan’s blog is culinarycourtesan and they’re in a very bad place right now.

You’ll receive an offer for a date and time further in the future. [Note: This means they pick a time and you say if you can go or not, not that the date they give you is tentative.]\n\nIf you have questions or if your medical state changes substantially during the waiting time, we request that you contact the Affective Special Reception, Uppsala.\n\nWith friendly greetings,\nTS-reception [Note: TS stands for TransSexuell]\n\n(For some illnesses, medical information is reported to national quality-registers. The register is used to improve care quality.\n\nIt is not certain that this concerns you, but if you disagree towards your medicinal information being reported to the quality register, you can announce this when you come on your visit.)\n\nSo I don’t really know if this means it would be the surgery visit, or if it would be a “first chat visit”, but based on the doctor’s visit I just had and the fact that I was told previously that the surgery would be done in Linköping, I would guess it’s a surgery visit. My wife is wondering why they’re doing it in Linköping when we just saw the surgeon here and he probably works here, but well I don’t know. From Uppsala to Linköping is a little under three hours by train or car.\n\nThis weekend is Culture Night (plus I have deliveries to make for work) so likely it’s impossible to try and get the ‘rents to start cleaning, but after the weekend I need to really clean up my own space and then start pushing them to

Seto Koji’s Blog 2\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n行きつけの飲み屋で！！？\n\nマネージャーと行きつけの飲み屋へ…\n\nそこで、ある人と会った。\n\n辻内 崇伸さん。\n\n元プロ野球選手投手、今は女子プロ野球チーム イースト・アストライアのコーチをやっている方。\n\n初めてお会いしたが、歳は僕の1つ上。\n\n1つ上！！！！？\n\n辻内さん「僕、老け顔なんですよ。あはは」\n\n瀬戸「僕、童顔なんですよ。えへへ」\n\n瀬戸心の声「このオーラ、貫禄はなんなのだ！やっぱり厳しい野球の世界でいろいろ経験している方は凄い。」\n\nこうやって飲み屋でいろいろな人と知り合う。\n\n昔の僕にこんな経験あったか？いや、なかった。\n\n大人になったな～。いや、社交的になったな～。\n\n同年代と話をする。\n\n活躍する場所は違うけれど、刺激を受ける。\n\nこういう出会い、大切にしたい。\n\nIn the bar where I frequent!!?\n\nThe bar where me and my manager frequents…\n\nThere, I met someone.\n\nTsujiuchi Takanobu-san.\n\nHe is a former professional baseball pitcher, and is now coaching a female professional baseball team East Astraia.\n\nThis is the first time we met, but he is a year older than me.\n\n1 year older!!!!?\n\nTsujiuchi-san: “I, have an old face. Ahaha”\n\nSeto: “I, I’m a baby-faced. Ehehe”\n\nVoice of Seto’s mind: “This aura, such a presence! As I thought those who experienced a lot of things in the baseball world is great.”\n\nBeing at the bar like this, I was able to know various people.\n\nDid I experienced this before? No, I did not.\n\nI became an adult~. No, I became more sociable.\n\nTalking with those from the same generation.\n\nOur activities take place at different location but, you will receive the stimulus.\n\nThis kind of encounter, I want to cherish it.\n\ntrans. cr; shin @ bakamitaii ; take out with full credits","image_permalink":"http://bakamitaii.tumblr.com/image/97225540657","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd7b8bde877e36cec690c530070bbae5/tumblr_nbqv717hg21tpu779o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bd7b8bde877e36cec690c530070bbae5/tumblr_nbqv717hg21tpu779o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":250,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bd7b8bde877e36cec690c530070bbae5/tumblr_nbqv717hg21tpu779o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd7b8bde877e36cec690c530070bbae5/tumblr_nbqv717hg21tpu779o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd7b8bde877e36cec690c530070bbae5/tumblr_nbqv717hg21tpu779o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":480,"height":480,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bd7b8bde877e36cec690c530070bbae5/tumblr_nbqv717hg21tpu779o1_500.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"jaimegandarilla","id":97225445493,"post_url":"http://jaimegandarilla.tumblr.com/post/97225445493/i-sucky-sucky-nice-sex-no-compromise-blonde-25","slug":"i-sucky-sucky-nice-sex-no-compromise-blonde-25","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 16:00:23 GMT","timestamp":1410451223,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"yMsugInl","tags":["gay","lesbian","trans","queer","lgbt","lgbtq","lgbtqia","joto","puto","maricon","Mexico","méxico","querétaro","queretaro","qro","mx","distrito federal","mexico city"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZsyfIy1QZ5f1r","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"caption":"I sucky sucky nice\n\nSex no compromise\n\nblonde 25 y/o bottom (misspelled)\n\nPP","image_permalink":"http://jaimegandarilla.tumblr.com/image/97225445493","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":720,"height":405,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":281,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":225,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":141,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":56,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":720,"height":405,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/0efc65cc8be83408da2acc038b0394c1/tumblr_nbqv4nY6KW1qc4e9vo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"cassandra-complex","id":97225315607,"post_url":"http://cassandra-complex.tumblr.com/post/97225315607/im-transgender-and-struggling-to-get-by","slug":"im-transgender-and-struggling-to-get-by","type":"link","date":"2014-09-11 15:57:59 GMT","timestamp":1410451079,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"QkmOaV0Y","tags":["transgender","trans","trans*"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z3xzex1QZ59KN","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"title":"'I'm transgender and struggling to get by'","url":"http://money.cnn.com/gallery/pf/2013/02/21/transgender-debt/index.html","link_image":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_nbqv0nMTK71qizmwg_og.jpg","description":"These six people are transgender and unemployed, homeless, living on food stamps or facing piles of debt.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"adalynsdomain","id":97225201023,"post_url":"http://adalynsdomain.tumblr.com/post/97225201023/black-eye-nearly-a-concussion-to-my-temple-a","slug":"black-eye-nearly-a-concussion-to-my-temple-a","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 15:55:50 GMT","timestamp":1410450950,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"yNJMMbq6","tags":["trans","transgender","transphobia","domestic violence","domestic abuse","abuse","hitting","mtf","transgender abuse"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZVTFjm1QZ4jL-","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"caption":"Black eye. Nearly a concussion to my temple. A gash in my lower back when I was violently shuved into a skateboard with full force. And plenty of deep brusies. The top of my rights foot is black and blue. My legs resemble that of a cow. Black and white. I came back to live here because I thought we were going to start over and everything was going to be safe and sound. This morning a good friend of mine an older gentleman has decided to offer me a bedroom and a bed all to myself. Hes a really good person. And I thank him for that. I’ll be preparing to leave soon. And one of the reason I post pictures like this is incase the attacker decided ok to delete the evidence from my phone should I ever need it. I actually have a good friend who saves all the photos on her phone. Anyways I was stupid enough to fall for his shit and move back in. I deserve this. Once an abuser always an abuser. My head is swollen. My face hurts like hell. My foot makes me wince when I touch it. I cant put weight on my right arm because he hit me in the muscle area that my arm uses so bad it feels dislocated. My knee is so brusied im limping around the house. And my back.. my back is utterly disgusting. It hurts like hell to lay down and closes my eyes. Its gotten to the point we can just be having a coversation and he raise his hand to scratch his head and i’ll flinch. Im scared to even tell him when I have a photoshoot simply because its implied nudity because he will beat the fuck out of me. I have litterly lost modeling jobs and opportunities because of him. Like the time a movie producer came to meet me and was so fucking rude he refused to shake the guys hand. Not only did he beat the shit out of me but he took my estrogen and threw it on the floor along with my testosterone blocker. Then decide to call me a pretender. Telling me that i’m just a boy and this medicine helps me pretend that I am not. All this is becausr of my adult work.. my last scene I left and was going away. He invited me back saying he loved me and all kinds of shit. Knowing I did the porn scene. So I came back. And last night.. its been a month btw so to beat the shit out of me for a porn scene he knew that I did and supposedly forgave me for is fucked up. He finds this post the peice of shit will kill me or bust my 2000$ laptop to peices. So for my sake you guys keep an eye on my situation. Our relationship looks so great on the outside. Inside its ugly and painful.","photoset_layout":"21","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/53366f4929f45b01a7b5c0a395abedc0/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go1_1280.jpg"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2aca5163f6b4a0e1ca990268cadd301a/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go2_1280.jpg"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/95df053fb05261384afc8226525b533e/tumblr_nbqux2V52l1tjhv8go3_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"bakamitaii","id":97224351527,"post_url":"http://bakamitaii.tumblr.com/post/97224351527/140911-seto-kojis","slug":"140911-seto-kojis","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 15:40:23 GMT","timestamp":1410450023,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"iTbjJBoe","tags":["seto koji","setokojiblogtranslation","setokojitrans","trans","and bless all those that died or anyone that was wrongly accused for the 9/11 incident"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z7Imlo1QZ1Tyd","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"source_url":"http://ameblo.jp/koji-seto-we/entry-11923424400.html?frm_src=thumb_module","source_title":"ameblo.jp","caption":"140911 Seto Koji’s Blog\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nあれ？あれあれ？\n\n本日は雨…じゃないの？！\n\nいつもレインブーツを履いた日に限ってそんな雨が降らない。\n\nなんでやろ？\n\n「うわ～、あの人レインブーツ(笑)え？傘まで持ってる。雨降ってないのに、完全装備やん。ダサッ(笑)」\n\nって、なるでしょ？\n\nそんな僕は水溜まりを発見しては自ら足を突っ込んで、レインブーツを履いた自分に言い聞かせてます。\n\n“今日は雨なんだ”と…\n\nまぁ、こんな日もあるか～\n\nEh?

both sides of the fence.","body":"One of the few good things about being transsexual is that is gives a unique insight into the way that both men and woman live, something few people will ever get to experience. Now, of course, this is not an absolute thing: Some trans people do not and never will pass, and we obviously cannot turn back time and experiences our childhoods as if we were the other sex.\n\nBut it does grant you conditional entry into the social reality of the opposite sex. It also, if you are being honest with yourself, forces you to confront these realities and the fact that men and women are treated very differently within our society from the very moment we are born.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nNow, first I want to say that I don’t know a lot about feminism, queer theory, sociology, or any of that stuff on any side of the issue. I haven’t read any books on the subject (one part lacking time, two parts not knowing where to start). The extent of my education on these subjects is essentially reading statistics and the words of some very articulate women here on tumblr. That said, my beliefs tend to be most in line with radical feminism, a conclusion drawn partly through my own lived experiences and partly through reading the words of women.\n\nSecond, I want to establish my reasons for starting to write about this. For anyone who’s been following me for a while, you know that I very rarely write about being transsexual, and even more rarely write about it in depth. I will occasionally reblog something or throw out a comment or two, but that’s pretty much as far as I go. I am a hockey blog, first and foremost, and that won’t change (beware, all ye who enter for anything but hockey. Winter is coming).\n\nBut I wanted to start writing more about my experiences because there seem to be very few female transsexuals within this discussion. I have seen some FTMs and a few detransitioned women in discussions, but overall females who are trans or who have a history of being trans seem to be rarer than MTFs. As I said, I am not very educated on these matters, but I am well versed on my own experiences, and I like to think I am insightful enough to say something meaningful at least once or twice if I write a whole bunch of those experiences down.\n\nI also want to write more about this for personal reasons. I have thought long and hard about my transition and why I am doing it, but I rarely write anything down. I see this as a sort of way not only to share my experiences and hopefully contribute something to the discussion, but also as a way for me to organize my thoughts and analyze my choices and thought process. Ultimately, I am always on a journey to bring together my reality as a female person and my decision to take male hormones and socially transition to being a man.\n\nThird: Me. I am Jimmy. I am 24 years old. I am a female to male transsexual, and I spent the first 22ish years of my life living as a woman. I like hockey more than is probably healthy. I am a writer and a lover of the English language, for all its pitfalls. Reading has been the best teacher I’ve ever had and writing the best therapist. I currently attend school online full time and also work full time as a live in nanny. I live in Arizona, which I hate both because of the politics and the weather.\n\nFeel free to comment on this or any future such posts to agree or disagree or simply spread the information. Keep in mind, though, that I do not, nor am I trying to, speak for all transsexual men. I simply want to use this as a means of documenting my experiences and organizing my thoughts.\n\nSome topics that I intend to explore in the future: Looking back at the differences between how my brother and I were raised, examining how losing my mother at a young age and being raised by my father impacted my life and especially how I interact with gender, my frustration with the trans movement as a whole, and many tidbits of analysis regarding how I have been treated as a man versus as a woman.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"makarad","id":97224149135,"post_url":"http://makarad.tumblr.com/post/97224149135/alright-so-i-dont-make-a-lot-of-personal-posts-on","slug":"alright-so-i-dont-make-a-lot-of-personal-posts-on","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 15:36:42 GMT","timestamp":1410449802,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"wqtgJfbA","tags":["inky spills","trans","transgender","ftm","misgendering","dysphoria","I don't know what else to tag this as","looking for advice","why is this so damn long","it's not even noon and I'm already rambling"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zg69su1QZ0iYF","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"alright so I don’t make a lot of personal posts on here, because I usually just reblog fandom posts and important news posts, but I don’t even know where to start for this.\n\n(everything under a cut because it’s longer than I thought it would be. misgendering and dysphoria and unsupportive parents, if you’d like a summary.)\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nabout a month ago (august 10th) I finally confronted my mother, hoping I’d just blown things out of proportion in my head after I’d tried to tell her I only liked girls, and wasn’t interested in guys. I told her I was trans(gender), and that I wasn’t a girl. that I am a boy, and I like girls. our “conversation” - if you can even call it that - lasted an hour and a half. it only ended because I was sick to tears and wanting to express my pain in unhealthy ways.\n\nnaturally, she decided that the conversation - no, the entire topic - was over and done with after that.\n\nshe spent every opportunity I wasn’t interrupting her to correct her because she wasn’t listening to try and undermine me, and turn my past behaviour back on me. that I liked dressing up and looking nice, and it made me feel good. that I wasn’t like this before. that she swung both ways when she was younger, too. that I hadn’t even spent any time being a girl - in other words, wearing make-up and dresses and skirts and short shorts and tight shirts. that I just needed to find the right guy. that I could never pass for a guy anyway.\n\nshe suggested getting me a different counselor/therapist, and I’ll admit - I laughed. her intentions were not to support me, and she made that obvious; I’m her baby girl, and she doesn’t want me to feel so uncomfortable in my own body. she decided that a counselor would “fix” me so she could keep trying to live vicariously through me.\n\nevery “argument” she tried to “counter” me with was selfish and uncaring. ultimately, she admitted, before I just couldn’t let her beat me down anymore, that she didn’t even know what “trans” was, much less “transgender”. that, of course, proved to me what I’d known the entire time - she wasn’t listening.\n\nmy father is a bit of a wild card, but seeing as he uses “gay”, “flamboyant”, and “fag” as insults against feminine and/or flamboyant men, I’m glad I waited until he left on a business trip to try and speak with my mother on the subject.\n\nthe biggest issue is that she now makes even more attempts for “validation”; that is, blatantly stating that we are women and we are female and we have to stick together and we need to stand up against men.\n\nthis post turned out longer than I thought it would, but I don’t know what to do - I can’t move out yet, having no driver’s license and no job (much less knowing a place I can stay that will take an unemployed 19 year old with his cat and rabbit). I’m already aware that my mother is emotionally/psychologically abusive, and now she has my gender to use against me as well.\n\nwhile it’s thankfully almost autumn, it’s never very cool in Florida thanks to the humidity. I wear a compression sports bra, a tank top, a t-shirt, and a hoodie. I’ve fortunately got four pairs of men’s pants; all four of them miracles to acquire.\n\nI need to at least curb my dysphoria better, seeing as a counselor (and a plan to transition) are out of the question until I’m out of this house. google has only gotten me so far, and I’m so uselessly limited in what I can do right now and in the near future. I need a plan, or plans, or resources or something. I’m just…so lost in what to do.","can_reply":false}]

One if these has been haircuts. \n\nIn the past, before I was out I would go to my hairdressers with a photo of a boy’s haircut and although it’s a unisex hair salon the girls naturally presumed that I would want it adapted to a girl’s style and although I always hated my cuts I always sighed and told everyone I was happy with it. \n\nYesterday my mam asked if I would like my hair cut as she knew it was getting me down. I explained that I was scared they’d do a girl’s style and my mam simply said “right, come with me” and pulled me into the hairdressers. \n\nI was absolutely terrified as she dragged my hairdresser aside to have a word. She explained my situation but much to my surprise my hairdresser smiled and said “that’s fine, come back in two hours jake”\n\nWhen I returned in two hours, I sat for five minutes before she turned to me and said “ok jake do you want to take a seat”\n\nShe actually listened to me, she called me jake all the way through the cut and even cut my sideburns the way a guy’s should be. She was amazing and while I watched the style take shape I couldn’t help but smile\n\nWhen she had done I went to the desk to pay. She asked for £6.50 instead of the regular £12 and my mam looked confused but the hairdresser simply smiled and said “men’s cut”\n\nI don’t know if she realises how much that meant to me but it meant the world.

Do you challenge new genres consciously? \nJongHyun: I don’t really care about genres. \nYongHwa: Jonghyun makes rap. \nJongHyun: Oh, yes I do. I have liked hiphop.That’s true. Since every genre has its own strong point, I find it interesting to combine those strong points. What is important is to make good songs, not genre.\n\nQ: What is your favorite song in Wave album? \nJongHyun: Of course I have attachment to every song, but if I choose one, I choose the last track, \"How awesome.\" Even if I do say so myself, I write the lyrics very carefully. \n\n Q: It has a strong message. \nJongHyun: Yes, it is about ourselves. I wrote about our daily life, performing live everyday.. To live this way itself is wonderful. I titled it \"How awesome\" in this way, and it can be a message to fans, too.\n\nJongHyun: I want to try bass. In the end, band’s ability depends on bass. To understand band better, I’m still learning to play drums and bass.\n\nQ: Your new song seems to be about a man chasing after a sexy lady. Are you like that too?\nJongHyun: Do you mean my relationship style? I don’t chase after woman (says in a very direct way). But I like sexy woman. I think what “sexy” means differs in each of us members, but I like woman who are confident. I think woman who are confident are sexy.\n\nScanned by YFfTW (CLICK HERE for more scans)\n\nTranslated by @happytmg &

You can read the post and my response here. Besides annoying me greatly, it made me think about the trans women who have called me lucky and wish they had had some sort of odd physical development. \n\nBefore I go any farther, a few quick facts. When a male develops breasts it’s called gynecomastia. There are two types. Pseudogynecomastia is what obese men get and is just fat. True gynecomastia is actually not that uncommon. It’s usually a small lump of breast tissue about the diameter of a quarter. The majority of times it goes away on it’s own within 2 years.\n\nIn my case it didn’t. Before hormones I was 5’6” 180lbs and wore a 40C.\n\nLook I get it. I know exactly why a number of trans women think I’m lucky. They made passing a lot easier from the start. And if I believed differently, they could easily be used to argue that I really am a woman. \n\nThose trans women couldn’t be more wrong. There was nothing “lucky” about it!\n\nYes, many women can understand the feelings of shame and hatred at their body’s development. They can emphasize with me in ways that few men can. Only another male who experienced developing breasts can fully comprehend the depth of shame we go to though.\n\nJust take a moment and try to imagine having your body develop in ways it shouldn’t. Everyone around you treats it like a deformity and you’re a freak. Multiple doctors poke and prod you before declaring that you must have surgery. Not because of any health reason, but purely cosmetic since they agree your deformed. Just imagine what that does to a person’s sense of self worth.\n\nMany guys jump at the chance of surgery too. They’ll do anything if it means not being a freak any longer. Not me though.\n\nThe thought of surgery terrified me. No offense to any trans men who might read this, but I didn’t want to trade breasts for dead, trimmed nipples that might fall off and a chest covered in scars. I couldn’t see how that would make me feel less ashamed of my body.\n\nInstead I spent over a decade wearing a binder. Wishing they weren’t there but unwilling to get rid of them. Its only been in the past year that I’ve been able to start connecting with this part of myself. To stop feeling shame and disgust, replaced with feeling of acceptance and love \n\nThis is why you can’t say I’m lucky. The vast majority of men who have experienced this definitely don’t consider themselves “lucky”. Even for someone like me who transitioned, the psychological trauma far outweighs any minor benefit to passing that fate has bestowed upon me.\n\nAnd those of you who would use me to prove a point, your the worst!\n\nYou hide the complexity of life and rob me of my humanity. You turn me into an object. Evidence A, a pair of breasts and a dick. And in so doing, you completely miss the real truth.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what my existence proves or disproves. What matters is being a boy with breasts is a part of the male experience. A rare part, but decidedly male none the less. To be a boy with breasts only makes sense through a male lens. The effect it has had on my life only makes sense when you understand that I’m male. \n\nLastly, you strip all the men who don’t transition of their manhood. You become no better than the boys who held me against a wall when I was 13 and groped me to see if my breasts were real and whether I was a guy or girl.\n\nYour predators preying on those you feel are weaker than you! All you’ve done is show how little you care about other people, and proved nothing in the process.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"allaboutwu","id":97209154602,"post_url":"http://allaboutwu.tumblr.com/post/97209154602/140911-ureallywestlifeforever-sowk-press","slug":"140911-ureallywestlifeforever-sowk-press","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 09:47:00 GMT","timestamp":1410428820,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"sUPzey0A","tags":["吴亦凡","Wu Yi Fan","Kris","SOWK","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZNCE-n1QY7Vmg","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":97,"caption":"140911 UReallyWestlifeForever SOWK Press Conference\n\nMedia group question: This time, many fans will go to the cinema to support your movie, do you have anything to say to your fans?\n\n WYF: For me, I will work hard so that what the fans paid for would be worth it.","image_permalink":"http://allaboutwu.tumblr.com/image/97209154602","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":588,"height":241,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":205,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":164,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":102,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":41,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":588,"height":241,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/90bd250776b329281d4309649b872383/tumblr_nbpyuhiSj11tx1im9o1_r1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"galactides","id":97208975122,"post_url":"http://galactides.tumblr.com/post/97208975122/how-do-i-know-if-im-trans","slug":"how-do-i-know-if-im-trans","type":"link","date":"2014-09-11 09:41:02 GMT","timestamp":1410428462,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"ut2Au89E","tags":["trans","transgender","transsexual","gender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZbufXw1QY6pyI","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"title":"How Do I Know If I'm Trans?","url":"http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2013/03/17/how-do-i-know-if-im-trans/","description":"This is not the final post. - N … “How do I know if I’m trans?” This is, by far, the most common question I’ve gotten over the last year and a half, since I began blogging.

It’s a “sex scandal”.\nThe hip-hop community (and all media community) seems to disregard the difference between “trans woman” and “man”. You know, the bit where one person is a woman and the other is a man.\nEven Mr. Cee refers to the prostitutes he visited as “men”, while referring to himself as “not gay”. He would rather mislabel his own sexuality than for a second consider that transwomen are women.\n\n The entire community is talking about Mr. Cee’s “supposed homosexuality”, and are even pseudocompromising by calling it a fetish or quirk — before ever stopping to consider once that trans women are women.\n\n The prostitution aspect is minimal, and this “scandal” wouldn’t exist if cis people viewed trans people as their valid identities, but cis-society prevents this conversation from ever happening because it seems like it won’t even occur to most people to respect these women as who they are.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"fcyeah","id":97206141282,"post_url":"http://fcyeah.tumblr.com/post/97206141282/pronouns","slug":"pronouns","type":"link","date":"2014-09-11 08:00:28 GMT","timestamp":1410422428,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"194e2L4w","tags":["pronouns","gender","gender diversity","trans","transgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z0Gi5x1QXy05Y","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Pronouns","url":"https://minus18.org.au/index.php/resource-packs/pronouns","description":"Check out this awesome new ap, video, and article about PRONOUNS!!","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"thefeministagonyaunt","id":97206060921,"post_url":"http://thefeministagonyaunt.tumblr.com/post/97206060921/okay-so","slug":"okay-so","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 07:57:00 GMT","timestamp":1410422220,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"RRgFoZMh","tags":["trans","LGBTQ","LGBT","cisgender","cis","cultural appropriation","feminism","feminist","tumblr culture"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zvph_m1QXxiTv","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":5,"title":"Okay, So","body":"It really annoys me, and I’ve seen it a fair few times on this website, when someone will anonymously be like “oh, some question about trans/cis/queer” and the owner of the blog will be like “pipe the fuck down you cishet piece of shit! You better check your goddamn privilege!!!”\n\nLike dude, not everyone knows what cishet means, stop being so angry.\n\nAs I say, I’ve seen this a lot of times.\n\nSo basically, I’m going to compile a basic list of some things you might not know, and if you want to ask anything or need to know more, please ask! I promise I will never be rude or tell you to check your privilege. Those things are frankly unhelpful to the cause; I will tell you, because the grand majority of people mean well, just don’t know quite the right way to do or say something. Here we go.\n\nCisgender/cis: Having a gender identity or gender role that society considers appropriate for the sex one was assigned at birth. (i.e. female on birth certificate and identify and feel like a female)\n\nCishet: Someone who is both cisgender and heterosexual (sexually/romantically attracted to the opposite sex)\n\nTransgender: Someone who feels that they identify with a gender other than what they were born with, or a person who feels that the body into which they were born doesn’t represent their true gender (i.e. female on birth certificate but strongly identifies as male or feels like a male)\n\nNon-Gender-Binary: A bit more complicated, this could mean you identify with both genders, no genders or fluid about the whole thing (i.e. if you feel like a boy one day and a girl another day)\n\nFeminism: It’s just equality, we want to be equal. Nothing evil or “man hating”, it’s just about the fact that we’ve been treated unfairly and we want that to stop. We want to be able to sleep with whoever we want and get cool jobs that pay the same as men’s and get abortions/birth control if we need them. Just equality. \n\nWhy can’t I call a black person an N word because they say it/ a queer person queer because they say it: They can call themselves queer if they identify as such or it makes them feel good to describes themselves as that way, but bottom line is, that word has been offensive for so long that it can really hurt if a straight person calls you queer, even if you say that about yourself (awful example: I call myself several cruel “ginger” names for fun, but it stings when someone calls me an ugly ginger fucker).\n\nCultural appropriation: When someone who doesn’t know much about another culture does something sacred to that culture just because it’s fashionable - it can be pretty offensive (i.e. me going to a Hindu temple when I travelled around Nepal, a country that I’m fascinated by, and receiving a bindi = fine. Skinny, white hipster wearing a bindi to a music festival to seem cool and boho = not really fine) \n\nThat’s about all I can think of for the time being, please let me know if this was helpful, want anything else added to the list, or if you need more questions answered, even if they seem a little silly, this is a safe space to ask! :)","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"dirtygaythreesome","id":97206006753,"post_url":"http://dirtygaythreesome.tumblr.com/post/97206006753/15-experts-debunk-right-wing-transgender-bathroom-myth","slug":"15-experts-debunk-right-wing-transgender-bathroom-myth","type":"link","date":"2014-09-11 07:55:49 GMT","timestamp":1410422149,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"AsfJYIWc","tags":["trans","transgender","link","tw transphobia","tw sexism","tw cissexim","tw fox news mention"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zo4Pyq1QXxVFX","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"15 Experts Debunk Right-Wing Transgender Bathroom Myth","url":"http://mediamatters.org/research/2014/03/20/15-experts-debunk-right-wing-transgender-bathro/198533","link_image":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_nbq8p1kSiK1sdw096_og.jpg","description":"Experts in 12 states — including law enforcement officials, government employees, and advocates for victims of sexual assault — have debunked the right-wing myth that sexual predators will exploit transgender non-discrimination laws to sneak into women’s restrooms, calling the myth baseless and “beyond specious.”","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"ninjask","id":97204841339,"post_url":"http://ninjask.tumblr.com/post/97204841339/seriously-people","slug":"seriously-people","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 07:18:30 GMT","timestamp":1410419910,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"QKrcE5PL","tags":["feels","feelings","sexuality","lgbt","trans","transgender","signal boost"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zl4-Gy1QXt2jx","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Seriously People","body":"I dont care what you indentify with as your sexuality just do this https://s3.amazonaws.com/bmo_quiltbagjam/submissions/games/000/000/002/original/PassingGlance_WorkingCopy.html?1383523838# a couple times and realize what you might not know about how others feel","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"none-of-us-is-yet-a-robot","id":97204680209,"post_url":"http://none-of-us-is-yet-a-robot.tumblr.com/post/97204680209/an-enormous-pile-of-receipts-i-am-in-brighton","slug":"an-enormous-pile-of-receipts-i-am-in-brighton","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 07:13:47 GMT","timestamp":1410419627,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"jZhjo920","tags":["trans","transgender","trans shit","bleurgh"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZR_Stm1QXsROH","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"caption":"An enormous pile of receipts! \n\nI am in Brighton for a few days working on the None of us is Yet a Robot project and my friend and I went shopping as I have a costume budget to spend.

In the apprenticeship program, similar to a beauty school model, TransTech offers creative technology services including but not limited to, web development and graphic design, that are worked on by students and educators at affordable prices for consumers. 100% of the profits go back into the program. TransTech is a social enterprise structure that is meant to maximize economic improvement and well-being within the LGBTQ community, rather than focusing on maximizing profits for external shareholders.\n\nTTSE envisions a world where no trans person ever underestimates their value. We believe in a world where trans-identified people can improve their skills and increase their value and self-worth without the threat of harassment and discrimination. A future where everyone feels empowered. \n\nWe recognize the unlimited potential for growth in what we offer, how we offer it, and who we offer it to. Our trainings are delivered on-site and online. Our training focuses on basic jobs skill like data entry and administrative tasks to advanced skills like graphic design, and web-coding. We structure this academy around empowerment, and education, with the goal to secure employment.\nThese three tenets, Empower, Educate and Employ, are each important parts of the educational structure and will include instructions on topics ranging from Power, Privilege, and Oppression and Scholarship Essays to Coding Skills and How to Build a Professional Network.\n  We believe providing a space where anyone can interact with trans people in a business atmosphere will create a stronger relationship with the entire community and also demonstrate the capabilities and worth of Trans People.\n\nOnly 5 days left - please donate +

Though discovering their gender dysphoria separately, the two came together in late 2013 to pursue their goals. Cecil moved from NY, to Columbus to share a life and love with Sebastian, as well as to share the experience of transitioning together.\n\nRecognizing that most trans men resources on the web are written from the perspective of young and healthy men, we cooperatively decided to run a blog together about our experiences of transitioning as people beyond the age of 25, as well as of people suffering from disorders and disabilities, and taking medications. Our story is not necessarily unique, but different enough, and we hope that it can give others like us the hope, courage, and help to continue along their paths in life.\n\nImportant: This blog may contain triggering language, but only when necessary. Activism and posts related to activism may occur. It will contain posts of a personal nature. It will contain photographs, videos, and the life experiences of two people that live a bit outside of the norm. This is not a Social Justice blog.

There may be a little bit of “Oh, that explains some stuff.” There’ll be some “Well, we thought you might be gay or something.” But there will most certainly be absolutely no “Yeah, I knew you were trans but didn’t feel like saying anything.”\n\nIt’s kind of cool, if still incredibly scary. I mean, I assume at this point in life the people in my life probably think they have a very good handle on who I am. I’m 28, not so old that I’m expected to have everything figured out (like anyone ever does), but also not so young that I should have no clue who I am. And it’s not that I don’t. Obviously, I have a very clear idea of who I am. It’s just that I cannot share it with anyone yet. And so it’s put a lot of discovery on hold. I can do self-reflection all damn day, but I can’t go out in the world and get a full sense of how I exist.\n\nI remember being about 23 or so and talking with my siblings over some food. It was likely some holiday, but nothing grand. Let’s just act like it was Labor Day and be done with the speculation. We were sitting around and talking, and one of them said, “When did ______ start reading?” They talked about how they out of nowhere, to them, when I was about 17 or 18 I had this collection of books and this little secret history of reading to where I could recommend all these books, yet they had never seen me reading during these years.\n\nSecret was always the default. Sharing isn’t easy for our family with anything, and when I add in basically hiding half my thoughts by default, that leads to some secret agent level shit. I used to sneak books home, hoping no one would catch me on the stairs and ask what I had in my bag. I would buy something else and hide the book underneath. When I went searching for a book, I did so alone. I had decided I would be a reader and I knew that if it were a true part of me it needed to be hidden from sight.\n\nI wonder what my dad would have answered if he were ever asked what my dream job was. Now, maybe he would know. I eventually brought my books out of the closet and majored in creative writing. But back then, could he even have sniffed the answer? I doubt it.\n\nThe last time I caught my family by surprise I was 17, almost 18. I packed everything I cared about and put it in my car and drove away. There was some vague idea of moving to Mexico and getting a job and writing—though I don’t know if I ever really believed in the possibility. It was an act of escape. I ran away. Outside San Diego my resolve broke and the loneliness seeped in and I realized how dumb I was being and I just wanted to go back. I turned around and drove straight back. Other than stopping for food and driving along the coast, I really didn’t do much. I just drove and thought and thought and thought.\n\nThe return was a smart choice, but it was a coward’s choice. I went back and told a half truth of why I ran. I went back and cut myself off from the world and finished up school on my own. I went back and told myself it was okay. I went back and didn’t talk to people about having left.\n\nWhen I first tried to write about this event it came out completely muddled in one of those underground writing workshops that are more diary sharing hours than actual craft discussions (so, this basically). I was still trying to write around the depression. Some classmates were kind, and found parts to praise. Others were dicks, but that was always their role in those discussions. And I sat there, listening, but knowing “I cannot tell you the whole truth because I will not accept it is true.”\n\nRunning away was a long time coming and the culmination of one of the deepest depressions I’ve ever dealt with. To those that knew me then, it seemed to come from nowhere. To me it was just the unfortunate peak of a lost year. It was the dumb stunt that granted me one of the few moments of control in a life I rarely felt was my own. The six months before I had been depressed and alone, the six months after I was depressed and alone.\n\nI got better, or something like better. I don’t know. It’s hard to see the edges of this for me, but I know it faded and things grew better for me and it’s never really been quite that bad since, even when it’s been really bad sometimes. The depression always seems to lurk and the decisions I make in the fog carry the risk of fucking me over. I nearly quit my credential program with a month left to go and $20,000 of debt, a no gain all loss decision that seemed like the right thing to do in that moment. It grabs hold of your brain and seeps into your life and nothing feels worth the price of effort. That would have surprised everyone.\n\nBut I didn’t. I stuck with it and now I’m teaching and getting paid. The debt won’t go away, but at least I’ll make a couple bucks and have some good work experience—things the depression would have robbed me of. I did everything everyone expected of me. I’m very capable when I try, even when dealing with all of this—though I’ve never let anyone know about it in full. I think they can see it. I think they can feel it. And if I were to tell them I deal with depression they wouldn’t be surprised.\n\nBut no one at all will see me being trans. Being trans is not the only cause of my depression, but it’s a multiplier for sure. But ordering hormones, deciding on this path, this wasn’t a depression choice. This was the other me. The secret me that read books, even if she felt she needed to skip lunch to get money to buy them. The secret me that snuck into the library at school and borrowed Dostoyevsky, but made sure no one saw me enter or leave. I’ve made my moves when no one else would notice, kept everything from their eyes, and cultivated their eventual surprise. This is an act of the full me, and one done from a desire for a future, not a fear.\n\nAnd then, once they’re all surprised, it’ll be my turn. Honestly, I have no idea how people will react, other than generally shocked and less-than-positive. I have a certain idea of how people will act, but only a vague sense at best. The fact is the day after I come out, I don’t know if I’ll still have any of them in my life. I think a few will stick, but who the fuck knows.\n\nI’m rapidly approaching the unknown. But that’s never been the problem; it’s when I think I know all the awful things coming, the pointlessness of tomorrow, that the depression comes.

Moo Seok’s longing for / missing of In Hwa (Kim So Yeon) stimulated emotions even while the story was unravelled in a descriptive explanatory manner.\n\n In the 9th episode of “Journal of Night Watchmen”, the reality that Moo Seok’s younger sister, In Hwa, had passed away from smallpox was revealed. Ghost In Hwa, who had appeared in coincidence with the juncture when an epidemic was spreading in the capital through the summoning of the “Mama-shin” by Sadam (Kim Sung Oh), and Moo Seok’s longing for / missing of In Hwa was intense and ardent.\n\n Behind that, there was Jung Yunho’s stable acting. From his debut production on the small screens, “Heading to the Ground” and continuing to his previous production, “Yawang”, Jung Yunho has continually been harassed by the controversy over his acting abilities. However, in “Journal of Night Watchmen”, despite the fact that it was his first attempt at challenging a period drama, he received attention for showing everybody his stable acting. \n\n Against the backdrop of his excellent acting, one cannot exclude the fact of the strength lent by the character of Moo Seok. The taciturn guard warrior Moo Seok was a character with less difficulty in the handling of his dialogue, and which was able to show off the actor’s strengths in his luxurious action scenes. In addition, amongst the characters in “Journal of Night Watchmen”, Moo Seok is also a character which has the most possibility (for growth / expansion). \n\nAgainst the growing-up backdrop of him having lost his parents early in his life and been handed over to the care of his relatives, and being nurtured as a warrior amidst strict education and training, of course other than his fitting personality, his relationships with the people surrounding him also have an organic feel to them. His sense of loyalty towards Gisangun and his heart in treasuring (the Korean word is usually used for family / closed ones) Soo Ryeon were shifted from the complex circumstances of In Hwa’s death, and his loveline with Do Ha (Go Sung Hee) undoubtedly possessed more compelling emotions than the emotions of Lee Rin (Jung Il Woo).\n\n Moo Seok’s past, which was revealed in episodes 9 and 10, infused the reasons for the existence and actions of the present him. Because of that, for the actor who is acting the role of Moo Seok, and for the viewers who are watching on, Moo Seok’s emotions were able to strike their hearts through such relatability. \n\n Of course, it is patently evident that actor Jung Yunho, who has digested Moo Seok’s luxurious action scenes and the minute detailed emotive acting even if he is taciturn, is undoubtedly showing everybody his acting abilities which have remarkably improved. In addition, in the scene in Episode 9 where his sadness towards In Hwa reaches breaking point, he also evoked emotions with his stable emotive acting.\n\n Moo Seok is an appealing character who, while having fine handsome looks and a cold and upright personality, harbours painful wounds amidst that. However, what made Moo Seok into a character who is so appealing, is the actor’s appearance, facial expressions, and his actions / movements. Jung Yunho is growing together with Moo Seok. At this juncture where Moo Seok has left the side of Park Soo Jong (Lee Jae Yong) and is standing on Lee Rin’s side, it makes one more curious as to what sides of him actor Jung Yunho will show.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nF: naver | Trans by mug_ping","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"thathumanthing","id":97196180978,"post_url":"http://thathumanthing.tumblr.com/post/97196180978/only-girls-get-periods-so-youre-a-girl-wow","slug":"only-girls-get-periods-so-youre-a-girl-wow","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 04:20:26 GMT","timestamp":1410409226,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"gQF9HcEC","tags":["i cant believe that actually happened","guess whos not coming out of their room ever again","trans","transgender","agender","lgbtqia","personal","ugh"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZuybOt1QXM0No","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"\"only girls get periods so you’re a girl\"\n\nwow that’s really cissexist and kinda rude you know I’m not a girl why would you say that to my face with that look that’s really not ok","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"alexisarealboy","id":97196012632,"post_url":"http://alexisarealboy.tumblr.com/post/97196012632/so-today-was-finally-my-follow-up-appointment-for","slug":"so-today-was-finally-my-follow-up-appointment-for","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 04:17:52 GMT","timestamp":1410409072,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"GrLZXwvo","tags":["transsexual","transguy","transgender","trans","testosterone","hrt","ftm","hormones"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZZzDoo1QXLNHO","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"So today was finally my follow up appointment for testosterone.

putting a lot more effort into my appearance, but it’s not having any effect. I still get called “sir” or “man” or “dude” endlessly, and it honestly hurts.\n\nWhat’s worse is that I feel like a complete shit-head about it. Even I can grasp the fact that it’s not other people’s fault. They don’t know who I am, and I can’t expect to just suddenly start being referred to as female, but even knowing this, I can’t get over how bad it makes me feel. \n\nI just wish I could tell my Dad and Sister, but I’m too scared of how they’d react. I already feel like a disappointment to my dad because I’m not the son he wanted (I’m a lazy degenerate who leeches off the money he worked years to earn and didn’t have a job until I was 20. And even then I couldn’t hold on to it for more than two months), so how the hell am I supposed to tell him, “Whoops sorry I’d rather be your daughter. Let’s just call this one a mulligan.”\n\nEven before this I know he suspected I’m gay (though is it technically gay now?), though I never outright said it. He probably would be supportive but I can’t stop thinking about what would happen if he wasn’t. He could handle me being gay but wanting to be a woman? What if he hates me?\n\nAnd my sister. She always says I can tell her anything, but I’m scared of even her reaction. Just yesterday I jokingly asked her if she was hoping for a sister when my mom was pregnant and she said, “lol no I actually wanted a brother.” How can I tell her after that?!”\n\nToday fucked me up bad, and I’m scared about tomorrow.

Could anyone please help me to start using the correct pronouns and words for transgendered people? Eg. What are the correct pronouns? I want to make sure that I use the words that they prefer and I don't want to cause any offence. I would also like to know what is the best way a cisgendered person can support transgender people?","answer":"All right, let’s tackle this.\n\nIt is not transgendered or cisgendered. It is transgender or cisgender, or trans or cis.\nAlso, it’s not “trans*”.\nAlso, cis does not stand for “comfortable in skin”. Cis is simply the linguistical opposite of trans.\nBeing trans works like being queer - treat us in a similar way, I mean. Ex: don’t out them, don’t constantly compare them to other trans people you know of/have met, don’t say it’s a phase or any other invalidating thing, don’t make them a public spectacle or your token friend, don’t constantly ask them how sex, relationships, transness works ie use them as your go-to reference for “life as a trans person”, and so on.\nThere aren’t any special rules for pronouns for trans people. It’s the same way with cis people - you use the pronouns they want used. Trans women are women, trans men are men. There are no universal pronouns for trans people.\nIf you’re corrected on their identity or pronouns, say you’re sorry and work on using the pronouns they want. If you don’t know or are confused about conjugation, ask privately. \nAll pronouns are valid pronouns. Because words are all made up and language is constantly changing. Therefore, a new pronoun has just as much legitimacy as any other new word in our language.\nAll genders are valid. Gender is a human concept and as such it can be interpreted and classified in a variety of ways just like any other intangible concepts.\nSex is also a human concept. Please do not use terms like “male-bodied” or “female-bodied”, do not identify any bodily characteristics as inherently male/masculine or female/feminine. Use DMAB (deemed/designated male at birth) and DFAB (deemed/designated female at birth) (and other terms like it) sparingly and only when necessary (many people tend to use them as replacements of “male-bodied” and “female-bodied” when that is not what they are). Refer directly to the parts you are speaking about, ex, instead of saying “female reproductive system”, say uterus, ovaries, etc.\nDo not use FTM (female to male) or MTF (male to female) unless the person in question has expressed a preference for these terms. Do not refer to trans people as “trapped in a (wo)man’s body” or “used to be a (wo)man” or “born a (wo)man” - only trans people are allowed to use this as part of their self identification. The proper way to say it - if you are allowed to at all - would be, “used to identify as a (wo)man” and sentiments like it.\nDo not support truscum or T(W)ERFs (trans (women) exclusionary radical feminists). Do not separate trans women from “real women”, or trans men from “real men”. Do not support the idea of “transtrenders”.\nDysphoria is a vague medical term that can be applied to a variety of situations, feelings, interpretations, and so on. It therefore is not the sole determiner in whether someone is trans. Being trans simply means you identify as something other than what you were assigned at birth.\nDo not call raising children gender neutrally child abuse. Do not call allowing children to break gender norms child abuse. Do not raise your children according to gender norms. Make it clear you are open to the idea that your child may be more than what they seem. Allow your children and the children and people around you to explore gender and identity.\nThey/them/theirs should be your default pronoun. Do not assume people’s gender. Do not use (s)he or she/he. Singular they is grammatically correct.\nThese are slurs (forgive me, followers): hermaphrodite, he-she, cuntboy, dickgirl, futa, tranny, and basically any term you’ll find in a pornographic video or website.\nDo not ever misgender someone or deny their transness regardless of what they’ve done, what they’ve said, how they identify, how they appear, etc.\nNonbinary refers to trans people who do not identify as solely women nor as solely men.\nTransphobia and cissexism refer to discrimination against and oppression of trans people. Transmisogyny refers to the specific discrimination against and oppression of trans women, who face unique challenges from other trans people. Cisphobia does not exist.\nDyadism refers to the discrimination against and oppression of intersex people. Intersex and trans are different - intersex people can be cis or trans.\nCasual cissexism refers to the alignment of being a (wo)man to certain bodily characteristics, bodily functions, or biological or social issues (breast development, reproductive health, certain cancers, jokes about lesbians hating penises, etc).\nDo not argue with people about trans headcanons (or any headcanons involving marginalized people).\nTag appropriately; try to tag transphobia/cissexism, transmisogyny, hate crimes, truscum, radfems, casual cissexism, etc. Ask your followers what they need you to help them avoid.\nDo not use “same-sex marriage” or “same-gender marriage” as blanket terms for the marital rights movement. Do not use “opposite gender/sex”.\nHere are relevant tags to browse: #trans | #trans rights | #transphobia | #casual cissexism | #transmisogyny | #dyadism","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"graveyardaro","id":97192464563,"post_url":"http://graveyardaro.tumblr.com/post/97192464563/its-late-and-dash-is-slow-like-reblog-if-u-post","slug":"its-late-and-dash-is-slow-like-reblog-if-u-post","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 03:27:32 GMT","timestamp":1410406052,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"HrN6G3A9","tags":["social justice","queer","trans","non binary","agender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZX-9ex1QX7r2p","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":18,"title":"","body":"its late and dash is slow- like/reblog if u post social justice/queer/trans/non binary things","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sinandsacrament","id":97192155710,"post_url":"http://sinandsacrament.tumblr.com/post/97192155710/im-only-roses-and-thorns","slug":"im-only-roses-and-thorns","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 03:23:18 GMT","timestamp":1410405798,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"NOIvU2v8","tags":["transgender","trans","transgenderwoman","transwoman","queer","feminist","whattranslookslike","me","GirlsLikeUs"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZknQMy1QX6fe_","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":33,"caption":"I’m only roses and thorns.","image_permalink":"http://sinandsacrament.tumblr.com/image/97192155710","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":500,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":250,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/83863e5cb9cd94a18d871cad50bb1592/tumblr_nbpw2u8Vtb1qbwz4ho1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"idislikecispeople","id":97191997038,"post_url":"http://softcisphobia.co.vu/post/97191997038/it-should-be-a-rule-that-every-person-on-tumblr","slug":"it-should-be-a-rule-that-every-person-on-tumblr","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 03:21:15 GMT","timestamp":1410405675,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"Yu5wI4aY","tags":["truscum","tranburger","cishet","cisphobia","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z6gLrn1QX62vk","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":42,"title":"","body":"It should be a rule that every person on tumblr should put their gender and pronouns in their sidebar/about.

Could I request a ficlet of Trans!Kobra binding with Ace bandages and one of the others finding out and freaking out and telling him that he shouldn't do that? :3","answer":"Suggest a ficlet!\n\n Kobra Kid took a roll of elastic bandages from the steel kitchen cabinet, then knelt down in front of the oven. He pulled off his yellow zebra-patterned shirt, then sucked in his breath and looked at his reflection in the oven door. After pressing an arm over his chest and seeing how it would look if it were flat, he glanced out the doorway. The main area was empty. Party Poison was still in the gas station, and Fun Ghoul and Jet Star were on their way to Zone Two. Kobra swallowed down his nerves, then unrolled the bandage.\n  [[MORE]]\n  Holding his breath, he wrapped the bandage once around his chest and pinned it into place, wincing when the safety pin jabbed his skin. When he exhaled, his chest ached from the tight compression. He wrapped the bandages around himself as closely as he could, pulling tight as if he were wrapping a Christmas present. His breathing grew restricted and the pain increased, but his chest looked flat in the oven reflection.\n\n  Just when he was about to snip off the bandage from the roll and pin it together, someone said “Kobra! No!” Kobra whirled around to see Poison standing in the doorway, wearing the blue gas station apron. “Shit, Kid, what are you doing?” he said, hurrying into the kitchen.\n\n  He looked down at his chest in confusion. “I’m just wrapping my chest,” he said. “To make it flatter. What? You didn’t think I was injured, did you?”\n\n  “Oh, no. It’s those bandages. You better take those off, Kid. Those could crack your ribs.”\n\n  Kobra’s eyes widened. “What? Seriously?”\n\n  “Yeah. They can be dangerous.” Poison crouched down beside him. “Come on, you better take them off. Do you need some help?”\n\n  “I think I’ve got it.” He unwound the bandages, then dropped them on the floor and wrapped his arms around his chest. The tight compression was gone, and he took a few deep lungfuls of air.\n\n  “It looked like you had them on pretty tight,” Poison said, winding the bandage around the roll. “That could’ve hurt you pretty badly.” Suddenly he paused. “You haven’t done this before, have you?”\n\n  “Oh, no,” Kobra said as he slipped his T-shirt back on. “This is the first time. I heard a couple of guys on the radio talking about it.”\n\n  “Well, don’t listen to them. D and I were talking about this a few months ago. He’s known kids that had to go to the medic’s after using these.” Once the bandage was rolled up, he said “I’ll call D later today. He might know somebody that can make you a binder.”\n\n  “Yeah? What’s that?”\n\n  Poison gestured around his chest. “It’s like an undershirt. It flattens your chest without hurting you. We’ll have to find someone that can sew one for you.”\n\n  “You sure that won’t be expensive?”\n\n  “Nah. It won’t be too bad.” He climbed to his feet, then said “C’mon. Let’s see if we can find a tight shirt or something.”\n\n  After opening the steel cabinet and digging around in the pile of T-shirts, jackets, long-sleeved shirts, and sweaters, Kobra unearthed a green T-shirt with a Frankuloid picture on the front. “Hey, I remember this,” he said, turning it back and forth. “I got it when I was fifteen. Think it’s small enough?”\n\n  “What’s the size?”\n\n  Kobra squinted at the faded tag. “Size A4.”\n\n  “Yeah, that’s tiny. Try it on.”\n\n  After taking off his yellow shirt, Kobra pulled the Frankuloid shirt over his head and squeezed his arms through the sleeves. It clung tightly to his body, but not enough to be painful. He slipped on the yellow shirt over it, then smoothed it down and examined his chest. It was flatter than it had been before.\n\n  “Yeah, that looks good,” Poison said, holding him at arm’s length. “Just wear that until we can get a binder, okay?”\n\n  “Yeah. Thanks, man. I probably would’ve ended up breaking a rib if you hadn’t come in.”\n\n  “No problem, kiddo.” He patted his shoulder. “Just let me know if you need help with this stuff, okay?”\n\n  “Will do.

I'm not at all saying that you do it, I don't really know if you do or not, but I've been noticing a bit of a pattern such as how \"cis-scum\" is a (seemingly) extremely common term and acting as if all cis-people are detestable seems to be a very common orientation. Again I'm not in any way insinuating that you partake in this but it just seems like people are trying to fight bigotry with bigotry.","answer":"yeah trans people who hate cis people by proxy are unfortunately some of the loudest voices within the tumblr movement and it’s fucked up because out of all the majority groups (straight, male, white, etc.) cis are the most varied as far as other characteristics that would make them clearly not bigoted - there are plenty of good cis social justice bloggers that don’t fuck up regularly and yet are shut down merely on the basis of their gender identity\n\nthey do this partially as a defense mechanism, which is somewhat understandable considering the real and present danger to many trans people in the real world (and sometimes even on this site from those few strangely bigoted blogs that exist despite the majority of this site being minorities)\n\nbut it’s not understandable if you toss out the phrase cissexist like damn confetti whenever you think it’ll bolster your argument. it’s not understandable to send hate to fucking thirteen year old cis girls on this site and making them think it’s a crime just because they’re not trans and/or don’t know everything about the identity (yes, this happened; can’t find the link right now but i’m sure some people on my dash remember hearing about this).\n\nit is not fucking okay. i’m not cis and i think a large number of my peers need to take a fucking step back and realize how little they’re accomplishing and how much damage they’re actually doing to how the movement is viewed.\n\nand i know some of them will cry “people already view the movement poorly! we’re not making it any worse!” but re: loudly cis-hating trans folk on this site, i promise you, you are. here, have an anecdote that may help you view your wrongness.\n\nmy college has started a brand new sorority (rather, some people are starting up the branch for our college finally) that is 100% by and for LGBT people/allies. some of the people in charge are doing a fantastic job recruiting by being welcoming and very civilly educating people when they see that they’re willing to learn. one of the recruiters, however, is very abrasive and at times aggressive to people who make mistakes in the learning process, and she’s having a harder time getting people to want to stay and better themselves and become a good part of the community. i get the anger behind it because being oppressed fucking sucks, yeah. it does. but we have to learn not to expect the worst from people, especially if they seem like they’re willing to improve. \n\nso……

It’s like- damn, my mind is so far ahead of my body, gender-wise. I know I want to be a woman, and I find it funny that I even once questioned such a thing. But my body is like… snails, turtles, sloths and other slow-moving creatures. Anyway, I don’t work this week, but I told my coworkers, half-jokingly, that I was going to come back a woman. My boss, the same one I made that post about earlier this year listing the many bigoted things he says, said basically “yeah, we know, we just didn’t know if you were going to have the surgery yet”. So, on one hand- fuck yeah, everyone knows, on the other- shit, I hope they don’t expect me to come back a completely different person, I mean, nothing can make me magically pass in a week, even ignoring the fact that I’m not going to have any surgeries for quite a while, if ever, I’m going to look mostly the same as the last time they saw me, and they’re gonna see just how terribly slow a gender transition is. Anyway, I just might be like “ok yall, I’m a chick now” and hope they understand.\n\nAnother thing about me- okay, I work with all het males mostly, and their jokes about me are pretty consistent- every night, at least a few times a night- somebody will say something regarding me being feminine or me liking men or something of that nature, often overtly sexual things. A lady who sometimes works with us came up to me one time and said “I really hope you kick their ass for some of the things they say about you”, I said that I don’t mind it, and in fact, I encourage them to talk that way. Because, at this point, I really don’t mind it, and I think it’s a way of them reacting to someone quite different from themselves in a not-overtly-hostile way while still managing to retain their status as a het male (and all trivial machismo crap that goes along with maleness), a status I gladly gave up long ago. Also, a few guys have told me one-on-one, stuff like “you know all that stuff we say about you…we don’t really mean that right?” and I ‘m like yeah, I’m cool with it, because I am.\n\nI was driving home tonight, and I listened to a song from Justin Sane’s solo album (which, tbqh, wasn’t that great) several times, the song that goes “i’m a boxer, I’m from the southside of town, and I’m the toughest motherfucker around”, on a side note- this is an instance where I like that his voice is high-pitched for a guy.. Ok, so I might not be the toughest of anything- nor do I want to be- but sometimes we can talk about ourselves better after a disappointing day and staring at an uncertain future, or some shit. I don’t really know where I’m going with this…do I wanna change my name to Ivy or keep it as Ryan or go by Rivy, I don’t know if I’m ready for a female name yet, it still feels like something I don’t deserve at this point I have to earn it. This has a been on ongoing theme in my transition- me thinking I’m not worthy of something yet. My therapist said “ya know, you could probably get away with going by Ryan” but she also thought Ivy was a cool name, so who knows, the name Rivy sounds cool too…. maybe want all three. Just like sometimes I wish I had a completely female body, and other times, I feel fine with a feminized male one.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"thenonbinarytrekkie","id":97186952928,"post_url":"http://thenonbinarytrekkie.tumblr.com/post/97186952928/if-each-one-of-my-followers-donated-20-to-my","slug":"if-each-one-of-my-followers-donated-20-to-my","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 02:17:19 GMT","timestamp":1410401839,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"pdKlScs1","tags":["top surgery","trans","transgender","non binary","transmasculine"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZCWYux1QWopRW","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"If each one of my followers donated $20 to my gofundme I’d reach my goal.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"hazardousprototype","id":97186788864,"post_url":"http://hazardousprototype.tumblr.com/post/97186788864/is-it-easier-to-lose-weight-when-you-are-on-t","slug":"is-it-easier-to-lose-weight-when-you-are-on-t","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 02:15:15 GMT","timestamp":1410401715,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"Fo2i5ae1","tags":["ftm","trans","i have so many questions please help me"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Za3uGv1QWoBO0","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":7,"title":"","body":"is it easier to lose weight when you are on t?","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"t-skittle","id":97186734014,"post_url":"http://t-skittle.tumblr.com/post/97186734014/so-yesterday-i-finally-did-it-i-transitioned-from","slug":"so-yesterday-i-finally-did-it-i-transitioned-from","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-11 02:14:31 GMT","timestamp":1410401671,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"k2fnIxbM","tags":["mtf","transgender","mtf trans","trans","comming out"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z2v8Lt1QWnz__","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":4,"caption":"So yesterday I finally did it, I transitioned from Travis to Tristin.

A transgender person’s gender is “on the opposite side” from the one which they were assigned at birth. Cis means “on the same side”, so cisgender people are on the same side as their assigned gender. You follow? Good.\n\nSo imagine if we didn’t look at a newborn’s genitals and immediately go “there, a penis; it’s a boy!” If that penis-having baby grew up to be a woman in the aforementioned society, she would not be a trans woman. We would not really have the need for trans/cis labels because there would be no assigned gender to oppose or side with. The person could perhaps still experience dysphoria and want to undergo surgery, but they would always have been considered a woman simply by the merit of their self-assertion as a woman. In this formula there would also be no truscum. No pathologizing of identity = no truscum.","can_reply":false}]

my gender confusion and to tell her that I may be transgender and honestly, some of the things that she said offended me. I know that she doesn’t know the ‘correct’ way to say things because she’s never really heard about transgender before (except for all the quote on quote ‘negative’ and stereotypical things.) it was as if she didn’t believe me. I told her things that not too many people know from my childhood as ‘proof’ that I am ACTUALLY feeling this way. how do you tell someone what they’re feeling isn’t valid??? I told her that I am more comfortable with myself than i have ever been in my life and she used that against me. she used “comfortable” as an excuse. she compared my comfortable to her comfortable of getting home from a 12 hour shift at work and lounging on her couch in pajamas all by herself. I tried to define my “comfortable” differently so she would comprehend it correctly and it was like talking to a wall. I then described it as feeling normal. normal in my boxers and baggier jeans. she didn’t know how to respond. I brought up the fact that I haven’t worn makeup in probably 3 months or so and she said she was well aware of it and was concerned. she was concerned that I would get “stuck in that phase.” she then went on to talk about me coming out as gay and how even though I was gay, I could still wear make up and be girly and shit and i got pissed and showed her plenty pictures of feminine lesbians and said that thats not how I want to look and that I am pretty damn cute the way I am right now. she compared me to being a dyke/ a butch. nothing wrong with either, but that is not how I see myself and is not how I would ever ‘label’ myself. She showed me pictures of an older friend of hers who is a lesbian and had short hair, no makeup and whatnot, as an example of what she fears i’ll end up like. guess what, the lady was fucking smiling. really smiling. shes happy, so who the fuck cares. I just hate that she fucking doubted the way that I have been feeling for months upon months. that she basically told me that this was all because I came out as gay. she also brought up some shit she supposedly learned in psychology; something like if you feel a certain way inside but cant/ don’t know how to let people know, you tend to reflect whatever it is on the outside that meets the stereotype. Example she told me: I had a secret that I liked girls but didn’t really let anyone nor knew how to, therefore, I became like the ‘stereotypical lesbian’ (whatever the fuck that is.) I began dressing differently, cut my hair, etc. she told me that I’m just fucking trying to FIT THE STEREOTYPE WHICH PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH HOLY FUCK. another thing that I hate when people say, which of course she said, is that I DON’T KNOW WHO I AM. I HAVEN’T HAD ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. i absolutely hate hate hate hate hearing those two things. it’s basically like telling me that the way i feel isn’t fucking valid and no one has the stupid fucking right to say that, ever. she then told me that I would ‘grow out’ of this in a few years. I’ll grow my hair back out, i’ll love to do my make up, i’ll be ‘back to normal.’ no. no. no. you don’t have the ability to predict my life. just because it would be easier for you to accept, doesn’t mean that’s whats going to happen. now, I will give her credit for a few positive things in this conversation; she told me that I would eventually develop into whoever I was supposed to be, and I said “yeah, even if I end up being transgender and becoming a boy.” and she smiled and said “correct. even if you do choose to.” she also advised me to not worry about it right now and to just be myself (which I have been doing and its great even though i feel restricted because of my mother) and that frankly, no body really gives a fuck what I label myself as. and I know I dont need to label myself, I’m just trying to understand what I’m feeling. It’s a constant battle in my brain over this. over who i am, who I want to be, and who I fear being. I hope that I can settle this debate with myself and be fully satisfied with whatever outcome and be surrounded by people who fully accept me. sorry for the rant, i’m sure 99.9% of you won’t read this.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"chutzpadik","id":97181800929,"post_url":"http://chutzpadik.tumblr.com/post/97181800929/female-and-male-are-gendered-in-exactly-the-same","slug":"female-and-male-are-gendered-in-exactly-the-same","type":"text","date":"2014-09-11 01:12:01 GMT","timestamp":1410397921,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"CNGOdrl6","tags":["noa.txt","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZuN1vn1QWV9dX","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":102,"title":"'female' and 'male' are gendered in exactly the same way as 'man' and 'woman' are 2k14","body":"stop misgendering trans ppl’s bodies","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"viceroy-bubbles-von-salamancer","id":97181473299,"post_url":"http://viceroy-bubbles-von-salamancer.tumblr.com/post/97181473299/cis-person-why-is-your-legal-name-different-from","slug":"cis-person-why-is-your-legal-name-different-from","type":"chat","date":"2014-09-11 01:07:45 GMT","timestamp":1410397665,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"p2CElniz","tags":["skeleton war","trans","transgender","preferred name","cis people","skeletons /","bones /","skulls /","just in case k?","war /","wars /","violence /","armies /","mothers /","parents /","death jic /"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZuzoPs1QWTveJ","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":36,"title":"","body":"Cis person: Why is your legal name different from the one you want me to use?\nMe: It was the name given to me when I was recruited for the Skeleton War.\nCis person: But it's not the name on your birth certificate....\nMe: I was recruited after the mortal vessel I call 'mother' brought me into this world and branded me with a human name.

She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn’t feel like herself in boys’ clothing. This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz’s story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.\n\nThis new book is awesome! Glad Gender is becoming more of a nuance conversation! Great to think kids can have a book to help them feel more at home in their body! Excited to get this for our class. We are very sensitive to this in our class and we are hoping to create a community in our class that in open to any identity that students feel good about themselves.

gender is complicated and I’m a demiboy.<!-- more -->I am twenty years old. That means that for five years now, I’ve identified as a trans boy. I’m twenty years old now and gender… gender is complicated.\n\nI grew up knowing I wasn’t a girl. For me, as a young teen in the midwest with a limited understanding of gender, sexuality, and identity, “not a girl” meant “boy.” There simply were no other options. Not that I really minded - for me, “not a girl” was (and continues to be) the most important, and quite possibly the only, marker of gender that meant anything to me. I experience dysphoria entirely because I’m not a girl and being seen as one or seeing myself as one causes me significant discomfort. To me at age 15, this meant that I must be a boy. To me now, this seems more indicative of something of which I’m becoming increasingly aware - I don’t really understand gender all that well, nor does it matter to me overmuch.\n\nI identify with the word “boy.” I also identify with the words “small,” “cute,” “neuroatypical,” “student,” and “queer,” and honestly, I can’t decide which means the most to me. I do not, on the other hand, identify with the words “girl,” “normal,” “man,” or “rude.” I’m not sure how important gender is to me at all, beyond the fact that I’m not a girl. I do know that a binary male identity doesn’t fit as well with who I am as I previously thought.\n\nAll that exposition, dear friends, leads us to the fact that I am somewhat a boy and somewhat… not. Halfway between boy and agender. I’m twenty years old, gender is complicated, and I’m a

I’ll open it and see a guy in a UPS outfit holding a package. He’ll hand it off and walk away, not thinking about what was in the package, not caring about how I feel about that package. I’ll open it up and there will be a nude colored binder. And I’ll probably freak out from fear and nerves and excitement. Because this is going to feel so right, but I don’t know how to do this on my own. I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. But I’ll finally be flat. He pushed me and pushed me and pushed me to be comfortable to be out to say my name when people asked. He taught me how to pack, how to dress to conceal curves. He pushed me to get boy pants because I was scared but I wanted them. And he told me to get a binder but I was worried about my parents. And the one time I really was going to get one but needed that extra push, that little bit more to get me to buy one, he just brushed it off and said ‘Get one’ and proceeded to talk about what he was doing and how he was. Like it didn’t matter. So I didn’t get one. And then he left and I was shrinking away, becoming less than what I was, trying to push Nikolai back into the hole he was in before, but obviously he had grown too big and I couldn’t fit him all in there. And my friends gave me that push I needed to buy this binder. My friends said it would be good for me. Not him. My friends talked me through it. And now I bought it and it’s coming and I’m terrified because I’m still not what I was. I’m still trying to fit any piece of my boy life back in that hole. I’m still afraid. I still need someone like him to say I’m a prince when I feel like a boy, not a princess, to fully see me as male, no questions asked. I don’t have anyone like that now, he was the only one. And now I’m doubting myself and I don’t know what to do. But I ordered it and for at least a minute I’m going to feel right. I’m going to be flat.

I know a lot of tumblrs have contests which require reblogs, but that’s actually against tumblr’s rules, and I don’t want to risk anything happening to this blog by breaking them. \n\nIf I made a post that was sort of an overview of what we’re about and included some pictures would people share it?\n\nAny other ideas?","accepts_answers":true,"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"gay-paso","id":97168719851,"post_url":"http://gay-paso.tumblr.com/post/97168719851/ask-me-about-my-feelings-on-being-a-work-in","slug":"ask-me-about-my-feelings-on-being-a-work-in","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 22:11:44 GMT","timestamp":1410387104,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"oXyMaskK","tags":["trans","ftm","queer"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZGXGvt1QVjF-h","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"Ask me about my feelings on being a work in progress #trans #ftm #queer","link_url":"http://instagram.com/p/syAJxhHhDX/","image_permalink":"http://gay-paso.tumblr.com/image/97168719851","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":500,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":250,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/5d5d3cf8180cb3ad32667258df2cdf37/tumblr_nbphnkXkNZ1rk1glxo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false}]

If you’re still reading this, then I’m guessing you don’t have a problem with that (and if you DO have a problem with that…get over yourself :D )\n\nI stuck it in there first because I figured it would save me some annoying conversations later.\n\nWhat I actually found was that it was doing one of three things:\n\n1. Putting lots of people off - This is a good thing, obviously, because it means most of the time, if people aren’t interested in a relationship with a trans girl they will leave me alone\n\n2. Bring in perverts - Not sure if this is specifically to do with trans or just for being female. Either way, I get a small amount of pervert messages.\n\n3. Invite ‘allies’ to ask questions - I’ve had so called allies message me and start asking me if I was depressed as a child and if I’ll have surgery. Nice.\n\nAnyway, my profile is several paragraphs. Not a lot of reading, but more than most people I guess. I don’t think people read it, so I’ve moved it to the middle to see if people are actually bothering to read it.\n\nLets see what happens!\n\nUPDATE: http://lordazael.tumblr.com/post/97168577106/dating-site-experiment-update","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"animalofhuman","id":97167862370,"post_url":"http://animalofhuman.tumblr.com/post/97167862370/five-years-ago-yesterday-was-my-first-day-out","slug":"five-years-ago-yesterday-was-my-first-day-out","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 22:00:26 GMT","timestamp":1410386426,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"h6vuqFrb","tags":["me","2009","9/9/09","trans","ftm"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zrh3hw1QVf_fY","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":7,"caption":"Five years ago yesterday was my first day out publicly as trans.

I am just as guilty as anyone. Handwringing can only go so far. Last weekend I started the process of volunteering for the Trevor Project. It is a very small step but a lot of small efforts from many people can make a BIG difference.\n\nI also think that, for those of us in the trans community, it is good for us all to stop at least this one time of year and look at how we are talking about suicide amongst ourselves. It is a subject that at times needs to be acknowledged and discussed, but when it does it must be done mindfulness—both for the people who are listening to our words and also for our own selves so that we are aware of how to keep our own mental wellness when we are engaged in these conversations.\n\nI know that some LGBT and Trans-focused organizations and individuals have done a lot of advocacy in this area year round. I have named the Trevor Project, but there are others out there. I would appreciate it if you know of any of these resources to please reply to this thread with information as I would like to compile as many as I can and make them available online.\n\nThere are a few other things that I would like to see happen and am willing to be involved in creating if I can find a few partners.\n\nI think someone might have already done this but I can’t find it (again—please send me links or contact info if you know where it is.) I think that there needs to be some readily accessible guidelines for how members of the trans community might want to think about when talking about suicide. I have watched countless threads on internet forums where a gender questioning visitor (usually a young person or, increasingly, children) will ask if they should start the process of transition. In most of these threads a number of respondents (much older adults) will immediately tell that person that they will likely get to the same point that they themselves did - ready to get a gun out and pull the trigger. I really do believe that we are helping “normalize” suicide within the trans community by speaking of it so often especially in occasions such as this. (If anyone is familiar with trans forums they will know exactly what I am talking about.) For many, I believe that this moment of very seriously contemplating or (in many cases) attempting suicide has almost become part of the Trans Mythos - a story of rebirth out of the debris of a life that had been there before. I am not here to discount those stories. I believe most of them are true. I even have one myself. But I believe that for those of us in the older “trans generations” can help younger generations find a new narrative, and set a tone where suicide is not something that is presented to someone right as they are “walking in the door” as it were. Let’s be mindful in our speech. \n\nI sometimes search for the term “detransition” on social media because that is something that I am STILL struggling through. So many of the results I get are along the lines of “I would rather kill myself than detransition”. I totally support the right of people to say that, but just keep in mind that for someone trying to hold their detransition together seeing this stuff online does have an impact and will have consequences of one form or another. If you need to say it, do say it. But maybe it is something you need to be saying to a therapist instead of shouting blindly out into the internet.\n\nA lot of trans people use social media to make suicide threats. I think it is a good thing that they are at least calling out for help. Many in the trans community rally around to assist these people in their time of crisis to keep them talking and distracted enough so that the suicidal moment will pass. Again, I would like to see guidelines for how these conversations should be conducted. Maybe this is already out there on the net (I know there are a number of things for the general population and I will be gathering those as well as publishing them.) If anyone has anything they can let me know about I would appreciate it. \n\nThe reason why guidelines are important here is twofold - both equally important. Firstly, it is important to know how best to interact with someone in this situation and how to make sure that they are safe and will ensure that they connect with the resources and professionals who it is critical they speak to. Secondly, and just as important, how to keep one’s self healthy in the process. Talking to someone about suicide can be extremely draining and, if not done mindfully, can seriously impact the “helper’s” own mental wellness. Boundaries are really important here. I think a lot of people don’t really take care of themselves when they are trying to help others.\n\nOne of the resources available to anyone in the US is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ Their phone number is 1-800-273-8255. For those who are not familiar with how the crisis line operates, it is a federally funded non profit organization that serves as a coordination point for 165 independent crisis centers through out the country, fielding calls from people in crisis. If you are trans and in crisis, this could be a good resource for you if you are unable to find anyone else to talk about.\n\nI deliberately used the word “could” because right now I know that a lot of trans people will not call this number because they feel that the people answering the calls will not be sensitive to their trans identities. I was curious about this so I reached out to the training department (in another lifetime I used to do training and quality control for a group of call centers so I am interested in this stuff.) I was surprised to learn that they have not received any guidelines on how to handle trans* identified people in crisis. (This is what I was told—if this is not the case, again someone please let me know.)\n\nWhen I first approached the training department, I believe they thought I was suggesting some sort of intensive new training curriculum for “all things trans” that I wanted the crisis line and all of its independently affiliated call centers to adopt. This is not the case. I think it can be as simple as a one sheet page of things to be mindful. I think that there is probably a way of establishing that when a caller in crisis comes through that caller is immediately given the confidence that they will be treated with the dignity and lack of judgement that is their birthright. It is also important to find a solution to “neutralize” the negative impact that a callers perception of being “misgendered” might have on them. For those call centers (or individual counselors) who have difficulty using the caller’s prefered pronouns, a few tips for effective “gender neutral” communication would be extremely helpful. It goes without saying that crisis counselors should not attempt to ”counsel” the caller’s actual gender identity struggles. I think a reminder in guidelines would be helpful.\n\nI would like to work with others to put together such guidelines. I believe I can offer some valuable input, but I do not have the expertise to do this alone. Additionally this really needs to be put together by a diverse but unified group of stakeholders. If anyone would like to assist me in this or has recommendations of people I can approach to partner with please let me know j@retransition.org.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the National Suicide Prevention Crisis Line would follow these guidelines—but I say it is at least worth a try and I believe these may be useful for other non LGBT-specific points of contact for people in crisis. \n\nAlso, I am hoping that some of the more prominent activists out there will build awareness that, yes, being referred to as one’s affirmed gender is important, getting “misgendered” is not the end of the world—especially in matters of life or death. I believe that if the gravity and catastrophizing of getting “misgendered” was de-escalated a bit a lot of our trans family would find more wellness. \n\nAnd speaking of “wellness”, there is one last point I want to make. I have watched over the last ten years as the subject of “mental health” has been purposely driven from the larger conversation we are having about trans issues today. This is also happening at the therapeutic level—so many who express feelings of gender confusion actually lose potentially helpful psychological assistance because of the fear on the part of many providers that to dig a little deeper looking at and working through potential root causes for GID would be to dishonor their patient. A false equivalence has been set up between the unspeakable and unnecessary damage done by so-called “reparative therapy” to some members of the LGB population with spending a little bit of time with a client presenting with gender identity issues to look for what really might be going on. I believe that it is possible to live in a world where we acknowledge that being gender non-conforming is a perfectly valid (and quite possibly immutable) foundation of many people’s identities, while also recognizing that some cross-gender behavior and ruminations can also be a red flag for something much more serious going on in the background.\n\nAnd that is the final point I want to make. We all know that the suicide rate (and the number of people who have at least contemplated it) is unacceptably high in the trans community. A lot of this IS situational. The effects of bigotry and discrimination due have their cumalative toll and there is no doubt they have been a contributing factor to some trans people’s arrival at a place where they felt they truly had no more options. Again, practicing steps toward mental wellness can be helpful here, as well as the continued efforts to promote a more tolerant and compassionate world. But I also strongly believe that there are also many deaths within our community that actually have little to do with being trans. What makes me frustrated is that I believe that many of these are preventable, but because mental illness has now been deliberately stigmatized even further in the trans community than it is for the general population (where it already carries a huge stigma all on its own) these people are slipping through the cracks. \n\nI say it is time to step forward to work toward building an environment that is safer for all and is even more respecting of everyone’s dignity. My fellow detransitioner thirdwaytrans is trying to untangle some of this in his website. Again, I know there are others out there (again, please let me know of any that you are familiar with.) In the coming days I too will be launching a website devoted to trans mental health based on some of what I have described here. It will be simple—it is just meant as another signpost for those who are struggling to find their way. In my case, my own path involved detransition, but I know this is certainly not for everyone so that is why I am planning on this second site that only focuses on trans mental health. My hope is to be one of many trans related sites that remind those who are suffering that we always have more options in life than we realize. We are never really “stuck” as long as we are here in this world alive today. \n\nI hope you join me in this conversation.\n\nJoel\nSurvivor","image_permalink":"http://retransition.tumblr.com/image/97161661248","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":439,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_1280.png"},{"width":500,"height":171,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_500.png"},{"width":400,"height":137,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_400.png"},{"width":250,"height":86,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_250.png"},{"width":100,"height":34,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_100.png"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_75sq.png"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":439,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/72bbe4a024d95eb3ef3b3d5bb9397591/tumblr_nbpdbrx79j1siqeg0o1_1280.png"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"glaminthebox","id":97161294208,"post_url":"http://glaminthebox.tumblr.com/post/97161294208/i-swear-these-two-hate-their-photo-anywhere-but","slug":"i-swear-these-two-hate-their-photo-anywhere-but","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 20:33:21 GMT","timestamp":1410381201,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"M7LKDQR5","tags":["myface","transsexual","transgender","trans","mtf","tgirl","transwoman","transgirl","lgbtq","lgbt","lgbtqia","lgbtqpia","girlslikeus"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZgFuEq1QVGx60","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"I swear these two hate their photo anywhere but fb…last Friday in Machine night club in Boston.","image_permalink":"http://glaminthebox.tumblr.com/image/97161294208","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":422,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_500.jpg"},{"width":338,"height":600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_400.jpg"},{"width":225,"height":400,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":178,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":720,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e020a4990cb64d3f91c4a554e02cf07c/tumblr_nbpd3lN6xE1skzd8vo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"perslapi","id":97160107198,"post_url":"http://perslapi.tumblr.com/post/97160107198/about-trans-and-lgb-health-care","slug":"about-trans-and-lgb-health-care","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 20:17:34 GMT","timestamp":1410380254,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"mABEjwn8","tags":["trans","trans*","health care","LGBT+","LGBTQ+","LGBT","LGBTQ","personal experience"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZshbAw1QVCPI_","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"About trans* and LGB+ health care.","body":"This came up on my fb feed:\n\nMost of the comments are all “there’s no need for this!!!

I have had a doctor who didn’t even know that it’s possible to have reproductive organs removed without having a cancer or other dangerous reason for it.\n\nAnd I want to tell something from a personal experience that could have been solved in a so much easier way if we had a hospital that was specialized in trans people:\n\nDuring the summer my periods stopped. I haven’t gone on T yet and I were happy about not getting my periods, because periods are something I don’t want to think about ever let alone deal with.\n\nBut they were replaced with this continuous pain.

This is countryside and all of the doctors that work in the reproductive health side are really clueless about trans people. They don’t even realize that misgendering trans people is wrong.\n\nSo of course I refused to go to the doctor. I knew I’d have to go to a gynecologist if I went there. \n\nI dealt with the pain for months. My pain meds didn’t work and I admit that I were terrified about possibly having a cancer (there have been quite a lot of cancer cases in my family).\n\nI never went to the doctor and turns out the reason why my periods stopped was that I didn’t eat enough (my body had gone in to the starvation mode). That would have been solved so much quicker and easier by just going to a doctor but going there is a straight-up hell for me because of their unawareness about trans people.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"t3hsiggy","id":97159994200,"post_url":"http://t3hsiggy.tumblr.com/post/97159994200","slug":"","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 20:16:02 GMT","timestamp":1410380162,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"YVJ9qWeb","tags":["me","mtf","trans","dmab"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZkzuUy1QVBzjO","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":35,"caption":"","image_permalink":"http://t3hsiggy.tumblr.com/image/97159994200","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":725,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":425,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_500.jpg"},{"width":340,"height":600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_400.jpg"},{"width":227,"height":400,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":177,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":725,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/eddf38185fbf1ebb1440e3cb5566b76a/tumblr_nbpcaqjWWE1qa80wlo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"vrixy","id":97159746491,"post_url":"http://vrixy.tumblr.com/post/97159746491/this-was-hanging-in-my-school-there-might-still-be","slug":"this-was-hanging-in-my-school-there-might-still-be","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 20:12:38 GMT","timestamp":1410379958,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"rwkoKbei","tags":["trans","transgender","the spider life"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z9iW-t1QVB1Ex","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":17,"caption":"this was hanging in my school\nthere might still be hope","image_permalink":"http://vrixy.tumblr.com/image/97159746491","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/32fc4ef91829eacbffc4317b31bf0f91/tumblr_nbpc52H1wa1rj2c83o1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"boblg","id":97159082908,"post_url":"http://boblg.tumblr.com/post/97159082908/morning-pee-no-spillage-stp-i-think-thats-a","slug":"morning-pee-no-spillage-stp-i-think-thats-a","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 20:03:41 GMT","timestamp":1410379421,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"iJOf5I81","tags":["ftm","transman","trans","f2m"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZjttRr1QV8VES","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"Morning pee, no spillage, stp.

In some ways it feels shallow to imagine that such a core part of my identity is just about performance, but when you consider “gender performance” as more than just clothes and as something we all engage in (consciously or not), it becomes a little more nuanced and complex. We all have range and variance in our identities, we all deal with the difference between our own expression and others’ perceptions, and we all negotiate the expectations (on our appearance & behavior) of different spaces and contexts.\n\nThis quote from the article in particular stuck out to me in thinking along those lines:\n\n\"Some people ask me which one of the pictures I identify most with. This is a funny question, since the goal of my photo series was to go beyond this unambiguous \"real\" identity and to propose a multitude of possible identities. I do not believe in one form of identity.

Da mich das, was da so geschrieben wurde, ziemlich nervt, wird dieser Text wahrscheinlich recht lang. \n\nDer Beitrag ist im Grunde eine Inhaltszusammenfassung des Buchs „Gender Hurts“ von Sheila Jeffries, wobei dem Inhalt des Buchs kritiklos zugestimmt wird. Im folgenden zitiere ich aus dem Artikel und stelle den Zitaten meine Meinung gegenüber. \n\nEine kurze Begriffserklärung für die, die sich damit noch nicht auskennen:\n\nTransfrau: Eine Frau, die bei der Geburt als „männlich“ eingestuft wurde\n\nTransmann: Ein Mann, der bei der Geburt als „weiblich“ eingestuft wurde\n\nCisfrau: Eine Frau, die bei der Geburt als „weiblich“ eingestuft wurde\n\nCismann: Ein Mann, der bei der Geburt als „männlich“ eingestuft wurde\n\nDer Beitrag ist betitel mit „Gender Hurts - und Transgender auch“. Das hat mich stutzig gemacht. Dass Gender, also die gesellschaftlich fabrizierte Vorstellung von Geschlecht, „wehtut“, dieser Meinung bin ich auch. Ohne diese festen Vorstellungen, wie Männer bzw. Frauen sein sollten, oder dass es nur diese beiden Geschlechter gibt, wären wir alle besser dran. Aber Transsexualität tut doch niemandem weh. Oder?\n\nDer Text beginnt mit einer kurzen Einführung zum Begriff Gender und Transsexualität. \n\nSheila Jeffries argumentiert, dass „Gender“ Menschen und die Gesellschaft verletzt („Gender Hurts“). Das Konzept von Gender unterstützt ihrer Meinung nach die Idee, dass es so etwas wie ein natürliches Geschlecht gibt, mit einer dazugehörigen Psyche und Verhaltensmustern, die genau zu Menschen mit bestimmten Körpern passen.\n\nSo weit, so gut. Doch dann begann der Text für mich ziemlich schräg zu klingen: \n\nAus der feministischen Perspektive aber ist Gender die Basis für das politische System männlicher Dominanz. Oder einfacher gesagt: ohne Transgender gäbe es kein Gender. Transgender unterstützt die Idee stereotyper Geschlechterrollen. Die Grundlage des Feminismus ist es aber, dass Frauen unabhängig sind von männlicher Definition von Weiblichkeit.\n\nOhne Transsexualität gäbe es kein Gender? Ich will mich ja nicht zur Wissenschaftlerin aufschwingen, aber der Anteil der Transmenschen an jedweder Bevölkerung ist äußerst gering. (Auf Wikipedia spricht man z.B. von 0,01%). Und so eine kleine Gruppe, so eine Mini-Minderheit, soll dafür verantwortlich sein, dass die komplette restliche Bevölkerung an das Konzept Gender glaubt? Wow, diese Transleute müssen ja wirklich ganze Arbeit leisten. \n\nDieses Buch wurde von ihr als notwendig erachtet, da bezüglich der Idee von Transgender eine Normalisierung eintrat. \n\nIch weiß ja nicht, in welcher schönen neuen Welt die Autorin lebt, aber hierzulande kann man leider definitiv nicht von einer „Normalisierung“ von Transsexualität sprechen. Fragen Sie mal Leute auf der Straße, wie viele Transsexuelle die kennen. \n\nEs ist für Feministinnen wichtig zu wissen, ob jemand behauptet eine Frau zu sein, obwohl nur stereotype Ideen des Frauseins propagiert werden. \n\nHier wird darauf angespielt, dass Transfrauen keine Frauen sind, sondern dies nur behaupten. Und wenn ich als Cisfrau behaupte, eine Frau zu sein? Wollt ihr in meiner Unterhose nachgucken, ob meine Geschlechtsteile das Gütesiegel „original biologisch weiblich“ verdienen? Wollen wir jetzt allen Frauen misstrauen, ob sie „richtige“ Frauen sind, und solche, die ein kantigeres Gesicht oder vermehrten Haarwuchs haben, erst mal verdächtigen, ein Mann zu sein?\n\nEin (sic!) begünstigender Faktor für den Transgenderaktivismus sieht Sheila Jeffries in der Entwicklung und Nutzung des Internets. Durch das Internet konnten Männer sich für ihre besonderen sexuellen Interessen zusammenschließen. \n\nBitte was? Transsexualität ist kein „besonderes sexuelles Interesse“ oder ein Fetisch. Es handelt sich dabei um die Geschlechtsidentität einer Person. Geschlechtsidentität und sexuelle Neigungen haben nix miteinander zu tun.\n\nAuch die Gruppe Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID), die Amputationen über Gliedmaßen suchen. (…) BIID und TG ähneln sich, laut Jeffries, da beide für sexuelle Befriedigung sorgen (und sicherlich möchten auch beide Körperteile entfernen und können sich nicht mir ihren vorhandenen Körpern identifizieren).\n\nAuch hier ist es wieder unklar, woher Sheila Jeffreys das Wissen zieht, dass bei Transleuten die „sexuelle Befriedigung“ im Vordergrund steht – sicherlich nicht aus persönlichen Gesprächen mit Betroffenen. Da ich cis bin, kann ich nicht für Transleute sprechen, aber ich habe eine Menge Texte von ihnen gelesen, und in keinem von ihnen wurde Transsexualität als sexuelle Neigung beschrieben. \n\nNoch dazu möchte ich sagen, dass Transmenschen nicht in erster Linie das Bedürfnis haben, sich Körperteile entfernen zu lassen. Eine Transfrau möchte sich nicht aus Spaß den Penis entfernen lassen, sondern sie möchte eine Vulva bzw. Vagina. \n\nUnd wer, bitte, geht auf Grund eines rein sexuellen Fetischs so weit, sich die Geschlechtsteile operieren zu lassen? Transleute machen das, weil sie darunter leiden, den falschen Körper zu haben.\n\n  Die Transgenderidee wurde, ihrer (Sheila Jeffreys’) Ansicht nach, aus ähnlichen Gründen (wie die Idee der Homosexualität) geschaffen, denn sie trennt nicht akzeptables Genderverhalten von akzeptablem Genderverhalten. Das Nichteinhalten von Geschlechterrollen könnte nämlich das hierarchische System der Geschlechter bedrohen. \n\nNochmal: Transleute haben sich das Konzept der Transsexualität nicht ausgedacht, um damit die Gender-Ideologie oder das Patriarchat zu unterstützen. Ich habe das Gefühl, hier müssten mal ein paar grundlegende Punkte zum Thema Transgender angesprochen werden: Transleute sind Menschen, deren Geschlecht nicht mit dem übereinstimmt, was ihnen bei der Geburt zugeschrieben wurde. Damit alle sehen können, zu welchem Geschlecht sie wirklich gehören, bedienen sie sich Möglichkeiten wie zb. der Hormontherapie oder zum Beispiel auch geschlechterspezifischer Kleidung wie Krawatten oder High Heels, damit die Botschaft auch wirklich bei jedem ankommt. Wollt ihr wirklich den Transleuten vorwerfen, dass sie nicht androgyn gestylt sind? (Abgesehen davon, dass es auch nicht-binäre Transleute gibt.)\n\nHeute werden die, die zu anderen Zeiten als homosexuell gesehen wurden und cross-dressing machten, als Transgender bezeichnet.\n\nEine homosexuelle Person, die cross-dressing betreibt, ist nicht transsexuell, sondern eine homosexelle Person, die cross-dressing betreibt. Ist das denn so schwer zu unterscheiden? Zum Beispiel kann ein Transvestit (oft als Drag Queen bezeichnet) ein schwuler Cismann sein. Nur weil ich homo bin und gern mal nonkonforme Klamotten anzieh, bin ich doch nicht gleich trans. BTW: Das wissen die Betroffenen immer noch am besten – und nicht irgendwelche anderen Leute. \n\n  Die Kunden der Geschlechtsumwandlungsoperationen waren mehrheitlich männlich. (…) Männliche Kunden fallen in zwei Kategorien: homosexuelle Männer, die sich unfähig fühlten Männer zu lieben solange sie selbst Männer waren, und heterosexuelle Männer, die transgendern um ihr cross-dressing zu einem neuen Höhepunkt zu bringen. 2-3% aller Männer empfindet sexuelle Erregung durch das Tragen von Frauenkleidung. \n\nDiese Statements sind doch völlig an den Haaren herbeigezogen. Ein schwuler Mann ist doch nicht das gleiche wie eine Hetera-Frau. Außerdem: „Crossdressing zu einem neuen Höhepunkt bringen“ und „eine komplizierte und teure OP, langwierige Hormontherapie und gesellschaftlichen Hass in Kauf nehmen“ sind nicht das gleiche. Nochmal: Warum sollte jemand das aus Spaß machen?\n\nWeiter wird der Soziologe Ekins erwähnt, der darlegt, dass einige Männer zum Beispiel vom Gefühl einen BH auf der Haut zu spüren, sexuell erregt sind. (…)\n\nKlar gibt es das. Aber das sind nicht Transfrauen. In diesem Artikel wird Transfrauen abgesprochen, eine „richtige“ Weiblichkeit zu besitzen; Transfrauen sind offensichtlich in Wirklichkeit nur „perverse“ Männer. \n\nDurch diese sexuelle Erregung erklärt sich Sheila Jeffries auch, wieso es Transgender Mann-zu-Frau so wichtig ist in die Toilette für Frauen zu gehen. Die sexuelle Erregung entsteht vor allem dadurch die unterwürfige Position einer Frau zu erlangen, sozusagen entmännlicht zu sein.\n\nEin heißer Tip von mir: Transfauen ist es daher so wichtig, auf die Frauentoilette zu gehen, weil sie Frauen sind. Und weil sie ihr ganzes Leben lang fürchten müssen, als Mann angesehen zu werden, gehen sie dann sicherlich nicht aufs Männerklo.\n\nAußerdem muss ich jetzt als Frau mal sagen: So erniedrigend ist es jetzt auch nicht, ne Frau zu sein.\n\nInsbesondere das Transgendern von Kindern ist durch die Normalisierung des Transgendern von Erwachsenen zunehmende Praxis geworden. Kindern soll die Qual einer Pubertät im falschen Körper erspart bleiben.(…) Ihre Reproduktionsrechte werden hierdurch auch noch beschnitten, denn sie werden durch die frühe Behandlung unfruchtbar und können diese Entscheidung als Erwachsene nicht mehr rückgängig machen.\n\nAuch hier frage ich mich, in welcher Welt die Autorin lebt. Wo ist es bitte „normal“, dass Kinder, also bis zu 12jährige junge Menschen, einer geschlechtsumwandelnden Operation unterzogen werden? Wenn ein Kind der Meinung ist, trans zu sein, zieht man normalerweise – WENN die Eltern nicht transphob sind! – in der Pubertät eine reversible Hormontherapie in Betracht (Bart/Brustwachstum etc). Und ganz ehrlich: Die Akzeptanz für Transkinder ist nicht besonders groß und ihnen wird auch nicht besonders oft geglaubt, dass sie trans sind. \n\nPartnerinnen von Männern, die zu Frauen transgendern, werden auch beschrieben. In diesem Zusammenhang findet der Fokus auf sich selbst und auf die eigenen Bedürfnisse, der Egoismus der Männer, besondere Erwähnung.\n\nWie oft soll ich eigentlich noch sagen, dass „Männer, die zu Frauen transgendern“ Frauen sind. Frauen. Transfrauen, ja, aber: Frauen. Und ich finde es auch nicht besonders egoistisch, wenn diese den Wunsch haben, den ungemeinen Leidensdruck, der sich daraus ergibt, als das falsche Geschlecht wahrgenommen zu werden, zu beenden. \n\n  Frauen die transgendern werden als völlig anderes Phänomen gesehen als Männer die transgendern, denn sie wechseln in der Hierarchie nach oben zu den Männern und erhöhen somit ihren Status. \n\nNur komisch, dass das von den Transleuten selbst überhaupt nicht so gesehen wird und Transfrauen und -Männer mehrheitlich die gleichen Gründe für ihre Transition angeben. Nämlich dass sie sich in dem momentanen Köper nicht wohlfühlen. \n\nDie meisten Männer die transgendern sind heterosexuelle Männer, aber die Mehrheit der Frauen die transgendert ist lesbisch und war lange Zeit ein Teil der lesbischen Gemeinschaft. (…) Die moderne Medizin hat hier sozusagen die unerwünschte gesellschaftliche Rolle der vermännlichten lesbischen Frau entfernt und ein heterosexuelles Paar, durch Transgender, hergestellt.\n\nAuch dies ist eine völlig freie Behauptung. Es gibt auch schwule Transmänner. Wie erklärt ihr euch die? \n\n  Toiletten zum Beispiel stellen einen besonderen intimen Rückzugsort für Frauen dar und müssen sicher sein vor Übergriffen. Sheila Jeffries erwähnt hier explizit das Pornogenre „upskirts“, in dem Frauen ohne ihr Wissen während der Toilettennutzung aufgenommen werden.\n\n… denn Transfrauen sind ja, wie wir alle wissen, nur MÄNNER IN VERKLEIDUNG und schleichen sich in Frauenklos, um Nacktfotos von den Frauen dort zu machen! Denn sie sind Männer! Sie haben ein Männergehirn! Und wie wir alle wissen, sind Männer schwanzgesteuerte Triebtäter, die sich auch mal ebenjenen Schwanz abschneiden lassen, um endlich in Frauenklos spannen zu können. Ganz ehrlich: So viel Geschlechter-Essentialismus ist mir schon lange nicht mehr untergekommen. Hier wird komplett verneint, dass der biologische Körper nicht mit der Geschlechtsidentität übereinstimmen könnte. \n\nEs könnte zukünftig auch zu der Situation kommen, dass Frauennotrufe und Einrichtungen Männer-zu-Frauen Transgender einstellen müssen und von sexueller Gewalt betroffene Frauen sich ohne ihr Wissen an Männer zu Hilfe wenden müssen oder dies dann auch nicht mehr tun werden.\n\nTransfrauen… sind… Frauen… \n\nUnd noch dazu: Ich persönlich würde mich sehr gerne an eine Transfrau wenden, wenn ich von sexueller Gewalt betroffen bin. Eine kurze Google-Suche wird zeigen, dass Transfrauen nämlich viel, viel öfter als Cisfrauen mit (sexueller und/oder transphober) Gewalt konfrontiert sind. Daher versteht mich die durchschnittliche Transfrau vermutlich sogar besser.\n\nIm „Chrismon“ kürzlich wurden übrigens für „Man-for-a-Day“ Kurse in einem Artikel beschrieben. Hier können Frauen erlernen sich wie Männer anzuziehen und zu bewegen, und gehen in dieser Rolle auch in die Öffentlichkeit. Es ist also alles leicht erlernbar und viele weitere dieser Beispiele sprechen gegen die Idee einer eine femininen Essenz und für die soziale Konstruktion von Gender. Wenn stereotypes Geschlechterrollenverhalten einfach angeboren wäre, müsste es nicht mühselig eingeübt werden, denke ich zumindest.\n\nDie hier als fälschlicherweise als „Frauen“ bezeichneten Transmänner müssen deshalb das stereotype männliche Verhalten lernen, weil sie ihr ganzes Leben lang als Frau angesehen wurden und daher das stereotype weibliche Verhalten lernen mussten. Transleute eignen sich lediglich geschlechterspezifisches Verhalten an, damit sie besser als eine Person des Geschlechts „durchgehen“, als das sie sich identifizieren. \n\nDer große Irrtum, dem die Autorin des Buches und auch die des Artikels bei den „Störenfriedas“ aufsitzt, ist folgender:\n\nEs wird angenommen, dass Transleute an sich Verhalten entdecken, das nicht geschlechterkonform ist und daher denken, das ginge ja nicht und sie müssten jetzt das Geschlecht wechseln. Tatsächlich ist es jedoch so, dass Transleute merken, dass ihr Körper nicht zu ihnen passt und sie sich daher mit jenen identifizieren, die den von ihnen gewünschten Körper besitzen. \n\nMeine beiden Töchter glaubten beide im Alter von 2-3 zeitweise Jungen zu sein (…) und insistierten auch, dies zu sein. (…) In jedem Fall ist die Vorstellung erschreckend was alles hätte passieren können, wenn sie andere Eltern gehabt hätten, die auch noch ÄrztInnen gefunden hätten, die eine Identitätsstörung diagnostiziert hätten. \n\nEin wenig Zynismus kann ich mir an dieser Stelle nicht verkneifen. Da hat die Autorin ja gerade noch einmal Glück gehabt; haarscharf ist sie daran vorbeigeschlittert, dass ihre Töchter im zarten Alter von zwei Jahren mit einem Penis ausgestattet worden sind. Wo doch alle anderen Eltern sofort zum Skalpell greifen, sobald ihr Kleinkind Verwirrung über die eigene Geschlechtszugehörigkeit äußert. Auch hier wieder ein heißer Tip von mir: In diesem Alter verstehen die meisten Kinder das Konzept Geschlecht sowieso nicht. \n\nIch lasse mir auch von niemandem absprechen eine Frau zu sein, nur weil ich in Teilen männliche Verhaltensmuster zeigen könnte. Diese Idee macht mich sehr wütend.\n\nHat doch niemand behauptet. Mir ist schleierhaft, warum sich die Autorin von der bloßen Existenz von Transleuten derart bedroht fühlt.\n\n___________\n\nWarum mich dieser Artikel so aufregt, ist vielleicht jetzt etwas klarer. Transmenschen stehen vor ihrer Transition unter einem enormen Leidensdruck und haben danach mit Diskriminierung und Verfolgung (auch polizeilich) sowie (sexueller) Gewalt zu kämpfen, die viel zu oft in Mord endet. Dieser Artikel (und das zugehörige Buch) scheißt auf die Rechte von Transleuten, in dem er sie pathologisiert und als sexuell pervertierte Abweichler und / oder Menschen darstellt, die nicht damit klarkommen, ein paar nicht geschlechtskonforme Eigenschaften zu haben. Das ist nicht okay. Es ist nicht okay. Es schürt ein Klima des Misstrauens und des Hasses gegen Transleute. Und das alles im Namen des Feminismus. Das ist nicht mein Feminismus. Das ist gar kein Feminismus: Wenn die Frauenrechte bei der Frage aufhören, ob eine Frau seit ihrer Geburt eine Muschi hat oder nicht. \n\nWenn ihr Gender abschaffen wollt, warum klammert ihr euch dann so sehr daran fest, wer eine Frau sein darf und wer nicht?","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"daleks-and-other-stuff","id":97152886281,"post_url":"http://daleks-and-other-stuff.tumblr.com/post/97152886281/its-interesting-something-ive-noticed-happening","slug":"its-interesting-something-ive-noticed-happening","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 18:31:00 GMT","timestamp":1410373860,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"KczdA48M","tags":["pointless post","personal","this has been yet another rambling gender feelings post","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZCMdyo1QUmsO9","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"title":"","body":"It’s interesting.

I've never really known many of the names so it gets confusing a bunch of the time","answer":"well those are two very different terms and i suggest that you look into the gender portal on Wikipedia or genderspectrum.org for a more complete education on the ground level but here are some basics\n\n[all pertinent terms will be bolded with each use - i prefer bolding to quotations as quotations can sometimes give the impression that the writer doesn’t take the quoted word seriously.]\n\ncisgender: a gender identity that aligns with the physical sex you were assigned at birth (so words describing gender (girl, boy) and words describing sex (female, male) can be the same in layman’s terms, especially for cisgender [cis] people).\ntransgender: a gender identity that does not align (either partially or fully) with the physical sex you were assigned at birth; subdivisions of transgender [trans] include genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, bigender, etc., but these terms and classifications might be defined differently for every trans person you ask.\ntruscum: a class or niche community of trans individuals who believe that being trans is a medical condition, and that you must experience physical dysphoria (aka discomfort with your physical primary or secondary sex characteristics or anything else that causes people to perceive you as a different gender than you identify as) to be considered trans. \n——this movement finds its opposition in the next term….\ntucute: a class or niche community formed in response to truscum; people who label themselves tucutes believe that you need not experience physical dysphoria to classify yourself as trans - you simply must identify with, or have gender “feelings” of, a label other than cis. \none could say there are varying degrees of tucute. some are simply people who do not wish to go through GRS (gender reassignment surgery), nor do they experience physical dysphoria, yet they consider themselves not cis (like my identification with the genderfluid label - i am happy presenting feminine and keeping my biologically-classified-as-female physical characteristics, but i feel like my gender is both male and female at times, or it switches, and i would be equally happy presenting as masculine except i personally feel i can’t pull it off right now).\nothers are more radical - these are the ones who come up with new gender identities daily and insist that people use nouns as pronouns (which goes against the linguistic purpose of pronouns it’s not supposed to be that repetitive that’s why they invented pronouns foir fuck’s sake) despite the fact that the pronouns may not even relate to their gender identity in any tangible way. the most extreme form of tucute (and perhaps the most pure, as it transitioned from just anti-truscum) is the idea that anything can be a gender identity and anything can be a pronoun set. \nhope that cleared some things up.\n\nnote: if anyone in these tags feels like taking me to task for the use of the words “physical sex” or “biological _______” or anything i have said that’s based in well established science, you better come correct. there’s a 99% chance i will shut you down for your ignorance - however, if you have extensive and up-to-date experience in biology and can inform me differently, i’ll welcome that knowledge/debate.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"originalplumbing","id":97152611692,"post_url":"http://originalplumbing.tumblr.com/post/97152611692/issue-14-is-here-grab-your-copy-now","slug":"issue-14-is-here-grab-your-copy-now","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 18:27:02 GMT","timestamp":1410373622,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"jkHamY8P","tags":["original plumbing","board stiff","trans","transgender","ftm"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZGtaAv1QUlpLi","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":9,"caption":"Issue #14 is here — grab your copy now.","link_url":"http://originalplumbing.bigcartel.com/product/original-plumbing-14-board-stiff","image_permalink":"http://originalplumbing.tumblr.com/image/97152611692","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":650,"height":421,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":324,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":259,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":162,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":65,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":650,"height":421,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2880abb41cfa968b91b9271f20b4a81b/tumblr_nbp792zJEc1rxpkajo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"lessthanthreepress","id":97152519907,"post_url":"http://lessthanthreepress.tumblr.com/post/97152519907/serial-updates-to-summon-nightmares-and-the-white","slug":"serial-updates-to-summon-nightmares-and-the-white","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 18:25:31 GMT","timestamp":1410373531,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"mHxKAffE","tags":["serial","serial fiction","lgbtq romance","trans* romance","trans","m/m romance","fantasy","urban fantasy","to summon nightmares","j.k. pendragon","bad romance","remy jensen","fairytale"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZW7t6v1QUlSxZ","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"caption":"SERIAL UPDATES: TO SUMMON NIGHTMARES AND THE WHITE CAT\n\nThis week’s serial updates feature new chapters from:\n\nJ.K.

It really depends on your relationships with your parents and friends, what you’re comfortable sharing with them, how you think they’ll respond, and the method you’re most comfortable with (some people express themselves better in writing, other people prefer face-to-face conversation). We have an article on coming out to parents that contains some advice that might help a bit. We don’t have anything specifically on coming out to friends, but a lot of the advice would be the same. \n\nI personally told a lot of my distant friends and acquaintances through a Facebook note where I could explain everything, I told many of my family members via letter, and my close friends in person. I didn’t just sit everyone down and tell them at once, for most of my friends I came out to them by telling them I was questioning my gender (because at the time I was) and keeping them updated as I figured stuff out. Since many people already have everything figured out by the time they come out to people, it makes more sense to do things differently then that.\n\nOne thing you could do with friends is show them a movie with a trans protagonist, a youtube video of a trans person, or bring up a story about a trans person and then you can start the conversation by saying “that’s kind of how I feel about myself” or something like that. In general, I think that giving them some context or information about what it actually means to be trans can really help make it easier and make more sense to them. Again, there’s no right way to do it. Just try to figure out what makes the most sense to you.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"myemberromance","id":97151529058,"post_url":"http://myemberromance.tumblr.com/post/97151529058/i-need-help-i-have-binding-down-ive-been","slug":"i-need-help-i-have-binding-down-ive-been","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 18:08:47 GMT","timestamp":1410372527,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"mch6mHcp","tags":["ftm","ftmt","ftm problems","trans","transgender","transgender problems","ftm transgender","binding","packing","help","personal","personal problems","boy","male"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZzUWjr1QUhh1Y","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"caption":"I need help..

My name’s Miko and I have to say, I don’t think I own an ounce of women’s clothing. I don’t feel wearing makeup and frilly things makes you a girl, not at all, but I think it’s adorable and feminine. Anyone can be feminine, or masculine, no matter the gender they identify as. Sometimes I wear a binder, but that doesn’t mean I want to be a man or that I am transgender or transsexual. Hell it’s just how I like to dress. I feel comfortable being a girl by being a tom boy ~\n\nBut sometimes girls feel comfortable being girls wearing frilly things. Or makeup. I think most girls are pretty without, but some are pretty with. I just don’t think it is needed. I know men who like to wear skirts and clearly identify as male, but they like feminine things and wear makeup and are adorable. I say if you identify the way you do, all for you!\n\nBut to say trans* woman are not woman, that is NOT okay! A blog called frickyeahfeminism (can’t tag, I’m on mobile) says that trans* woman aren’t woman. WHAT?!? What do they have to do to prove themselves as woman? Or for trans* men to prove themselves as men?! They don’t have to, that’s the point. I’m not asking you to prove your cis gender being, don’t say they are not valid. Do you know what it’s like for them to transition?! They don’t need shits telling them they are not real, so go fuck yourself. Especially for the trans* youth, they get kicked out and disowned by family and friends and schools and job opportunities for simply BEING TRANS* and cis people don’t have those issues for plainly being cis. Everyone should check out that blog and see what I mean… Please please please reblog this and other things I have or will be posting and spread the word. They are trans* kids/youth/people out there that don’t hear the good things and don’t have support and are told they are not valid and NEED TO KNOW.

I had been super nervous days before, and was glad that I maintained a calm composure (for the most part). I arrived at the surgery center around 6:20, waited for it to open, and headed in around 6:45. I filled out some paper work and then got taken back to get prepped for surgery probably some time after 7:00. I got into my dressings, got my vitals checked, and then signed a few more things. Another nurse came by to hook up my IV and then soon after, Dr. Rumer came over and drew on me with a purple marker.\n\nFrom there, I hopped back into bed and was then wheeled to the surgical room.\n\nMy surgery time listed on my paperwork was 7:40, but I heard a few nurses say I would be taken back at 8:00. I had no way to tell the time, so I assume I went to the operating room some time between.\n\nMy emotions and nerves were coming out in awkward laughs. I remember rolling from the bed onto the surgery table, spreading out my arms, getting my legs wrapped in something…and then nothing!\n\nI awoke in the recovery room with absolutely no memory. I was so out of it, and was trying really hard to wake up. A nurse kept checking on me and we had like mini conversations with me half awake. As I gained my focus back, she came over again and fed me graham crackers and apple juice, followed by a Percocet. I was still super giddy, but she commented that it was nice that I was a cheerful patient and was glad I wasn’t crying or screaming from pain. It was also great that I was not nauseous or dizzy!\n\nI was not in pain so much as discomfort, but even that wasn’t so bad. I felt like I had a super tight binder and could feel a slight ache in my chest. Honestly, from having my arms spread out, my arms were a lot more sore. \n\nSurgery was two hours long, but basically it was a gap in time for me. I was in recovery for an hour. I was supposed to fall back asleep during that time, but once the adrenaline kicked in, I was wide awake and ecstatic.\n\nThe nurse helped me get dressed and shortly after, my parents came to get me. She went over the post-op basics and the medications I had to take. She then showed me how to measure and empty my drains.\n\nFrom there, I was helped out of bed, put in a wheelchair, and taken down to my car. My dad reclined my chair, and I brought a pillow to prop myself up and be comfortable.\n\nThe car ride was fine, and I arrived at my home a little after 12:00 PM.\n\nI took some pictures for my own documentation while my parents got the couch (aka my new temporary bed) situated. I took my first antibiotic and will take my pain killers later today. And then tomorrow, I will also start back on Arnica for a week to help with the bruising.\n\nThat is it for now; I will keep you updated! Right now I am just on a happy high and am waiting to crash!","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"transtrenby","id":97148709118,"post_url":"http://transtrenby.tumblr.com/post/97148709118/destroy-the-concept-that-being-comfortable-in","slug":"destroy-the-concept-that-being-comfortable-in","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 17:20:25 GMT","timestamp":1410369625,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"BRRwOf22","tags":["trans","cis","dmab","transfem"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZqiDnv1QUWwZ_","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":285,"title":"","body":"destroy the concept that being ‘comfortable in your own skin’ and being trans are mutually exclusive","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"shantsir","id":97148610238,"post_url":"http://shantsir.tumblr.com/post/97148610238/transition-blog","slug":"transition-blog","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 17:18:40 GMT","timestamp":1410369520,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"dP909JO7","tags":["ftm","trans","transman","transguy","trans guy","transgender","lgbt","lgbtq","blog"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZopG0q1QUWYQ_","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Transition Blog","body":"For those of you who are interested, I have now made a separate blog for my transition.

I’ll be doing a different course completely, I was doing Outdoor Education but I’ve changed to Counselling Studies and I register on the 16th September! I’m so excited and I feel like this course is something I really want to do. When I was last at university, there were issues with my transition. I was bullied by the other members of my course because I came out in my 2nd year, and everyone else was really super masculine, misogynistic and all round nasty to me because I identify as male now instead. I’m confident that this won’t happen again, but in case it does, the college has a great support network.\n\nNext update…I have a job! I’m currently working at shitty old Subway, it might not be the best place to work but the people are fantastic and make the job worthwhile. I hate the job but I love the people. The management know about my transition and are all great about it, the only issue is that the bitchy area manager told one of the members of staff that I’m trans…she had no reason to do this and it was a complete dick move, but I’m in need of the money so I have to stick it out.\n\nSome of you may know, for the last 2 months I’ve been homeless. I’ve finally found somewhere to live! I should be moving in within the next 3 weeks and its a lovely place with people I all know really well (one of them is my girlfriend). I’m super hyped to live there and it feels like everything is finally coming together.\n\nI’m starting T next week. This has been almost two years coming and I am beyond excited. As of yet I’m unsure of the actual date I’ll be starting but I’m so keen. I’ll be on Nebido and I’ll be sure to post updates again when I’ve actually had my first shot.\n\nIf anyone wants to ask me anything, feel free. \n\nUntil next time, love, Harry. x","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"disabilityhistory","id":97145479639,"post_url":"http://disabilityhistory.tumblr.com/post/97145479639/being-transgender-means-one-is-more-likely-to","slug":"being-transgender-means-one-is-more-likely-to","type":"quote","date":"2014-09-10 16:22:37 GMT","timestamp":1410366157,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"9kdCvE8S","tags":["trans","trans elders","twoc","aging","health"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZRMMFs1QUKc7N","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":58,"text":"Being transgender means one is more likely to suffer poverty, homelessness and criminalization.

I decided on an art school that I thought would completely fit my needs: it had a diverse curriculum and a supposedly diverse community, with resources for LGBTQ students and several queer events each semester. […] I hoped that by leaving my hometown, I could get a new start in the city and leave everyone, including my “former self,” behind. \n\nAnd, in essence, I succeeded. \n\nWhen I started college, I got the fresh start I was looking for, found allies on campus and off, and now have a sizable community of other trans*, queer, and allied individuals that love and support me. \n\nBut at what cost?\n\n~~~\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThis experience hasn’t turned out to be everything I expected.\n\nWhen I came to campus, there wasn’t a process to get one’s preferred name on class rosters, IDs or any other documents. I had to email every administrator and instructor I was going to come into contact with and explain not only what the word “transgender” means, but that I will need them to make a mental note of my name and pronoun preference.\n\nI was frustrated by having to disclose my identity without meeting these people beforehand, but I was also scared. I constantly found myself wondering, What happens if an instructor disregards my requests and uses an incorrect name or pronoun during class? What will the other students think? Is this safe?\n\nI didn’t have the answers and I was terrified — not only that I might be misgendered, but that the other students in the room wouldn’t know what that meant and that they would react in a violent way.\n\nAt the absolute least, being misgendered in the classroom was a huge distraction. Around week ten, after everyone in my classes started to get to know each other, I once had an instructor refer to me with female pronouns. I could sense each of the fifteen students in the room take a breath together, and time seemed to stop to allow everyone to process what had just happened.\n\nAfter that, not only were my classmates confused because they knew me as a man, but I became completely closed off; it made learning astonishingly difficult. There were times that I would skip class in order to avoid being put in that situation again.\n\n~~~\n\nGender-inclusive housing wasn’t an option for me either and I found myself living with four girls.\n\nI ended up spending most of my time outside of my dorm, in study lounges or with friends, and avoided being “home” as much as possible. My roommates would consistently use my preferred name and disregard pronouns, which made me weary of spending time with them or around anyone I hadn’t yet met. \n\nEvery time I walked up to my apartment door, I began worrying that someone would see me enter it or spot our names on it and wonder why there was a male name among four female ones. What would happen if someone saw that? Would they ask someone about it? Would they ask me about it?\n\nMy first year in college was meant to be a new beginning — a way out of a destructive space. The problem is, as an incoming freshman, I wasn’t prepared to embark on a journey of activism or become the face of the trans* rights movement on my campus.\n\nPolicies should have been in place to accommodate my requests as a transgender student before I ever set foot there. I shouldn’t have to be asked time and time again to educate the faculty and staff, regardless of whether or not I would like to do so. Theoretically, I should be able to let my studies come first but the fact is, it doesn’t always happen that way.\n\n~~~\n\nFor some students, entering college may be a time when drugs, alcohol and socializing are their main focus; for others, student organizations and leadership roles fill that space. For me and other transgender students, activism becomes our main priority because it has to.\n\nThe need for safe, gender-inclusive housing and restrooms, a name-change process, inclusive health insurance, and a large range of queer studies courses is stronger than ever. College is a time of awakening, self-discovery, and growth, but until institutions embrace gender variance, higher education will continue to be as dangerous as elementary, middle, and high school can be.\n\n[…] Today, after finally coming to terms with my trans* identity as well as my queer sexuality, I have found myself in an incredible place. Sure, I’m working non-stop to pay my bills, both transition-related and otherwise, and I’m always a little worried that someone is going to disclose my identity without my consent in the classroom.\n\nBut now I choose to tell my story to faculty, staff, and students alike to create impactful change on our campus.\n\nIn the year that I’ve been doing this work, a name-change process has been put in place, single-stall restrooms now have proper, gender-inclusive signage, and we are working on safer, trans*-friendly housing. \n\nI didn’t necessarily seek to be an activist, but I’m not sure anyone does. Activism comes with a sense of necessity: If my college isn’t inclusive enough for me to be fully content, how do I make it so? How will what I do affect those who come after me?\n\nSo, did I ask for this? No. Is it fair? Definitely not. Does it take away from my studies and other college experiences? Sometimes. But is it important? Is it rewarding? Absolutely.\n\n~~~\n\nPhoto courtesy of Flickr.

I’m currently studying at TAFE so I can get the qualifications to get a job. Over the past 2 years I have been undergoing a physical transition and I NEED help to continue doing so. You see, I was born with the wrong body and assigned the wrong gender at birth. Since I can remember I have always felt like a boy stuck in a girls body. I am currently on testosterone that I pay $300 for ever 6 months for the rest of my life. I have also recently had a full hysterectomy and now I NEED to have my breast removed and that costs $10,000. I did have a person agree to loan me the $7000 I need (I already saved some money) but they have change their mind last minute. I asked my parents to help but my father lost his job recently. Any money I have left over I will pay it forward and give it out to other transgender people who need the money like I do. I NEED money by 22nd November.

I came out to my mom right before uh, sophomore year. So uh, and then this Tuesday actually I took my first injection of testosterone, which is really exciting. Yeah that’s another thing that’s been a long time in the works where basically for five years I’ve been waiting and reading and researching and it’s weird that…it’s like I’m finally here. I’ve finally started. And yeah everyone’s been absolutely amazing and all that so, that’s been good. Um…yes socially I guess I had a bit of a rocky bit here at uh Bennington just because the people who were in charge of the GSA thing….Oh yeah okay so the GSA was called ‘Queer’ and the two people who were in charge of it were very much made being trans and sexual orientation very much the forefront of their identity. Which I think is something that a lot of people…especially when they recently come out or if they come from an abusive or homophobic or transphobic background…something that naturally happens to a lot of people. But for me that hasn’t really been my past and I don’t really make being transgender or whatever the hell my sexuality is now um my identity. I mean it’s part of who I am but I don’t….I wouldn’t say like you know, I’d say there’s more to me than that. And they very much tended to do the same to other people, where if somebody is transgender they kind of make that into what that person is, if that makes sense? And so I…last year I just had a hard time because I realized that some of these people who were my friends that they kind of sought me out because I’m transgender, which I wasn’t too fond of and I started to wonder: do they see me as anything other than transgender or is that all I am to them? But this year’s been great. Those two people graduated and um it turns out there’s a lot of us who felt the same way and were uncomfortable with the whole environment there. And so we made a…we changed the name from Queer to GSMA which is just Gender and Sexuality Minority Alliance. Um and I think it’s a much healthier support group. Yeah it’s….last year everything’s been going really well and yeah this term’s been great.","player":"<embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://assets.tumblr.com/swf/audio_player.swf?audio_file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumblr.com%2Faudio_file%2Fourqueervoices%2F97115815700%2Ftumblr_navyumKjCN1tbynob&color=FFFFFF\" height=\"27\" width=\"207\" quality=\"best\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed>","embed":"<iframe class=\"tumblr_audio_player tumblr_audio_player_97115815700\" src=\"http://ourqueervoices.tumblr.com/post/97115815700/audio_player_iframe/ourqueervoices/tumblr_navyumKjCN1tbynob?audio_file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumblr.com%2Faudio_file%2Fourqueervoices%2F97115815700%2Ftumblr_navyumKjCN1tbynob\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"500\" height=\"85\"></iframe>","plays":12,"audio_url":"https://www.tumblr.com/audio_file/ourqueervoices/97115815700/tumblr_navyumKjCN1tbynob","audio_type":"tumblr","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"hiddenbeneaththisshame","id":97115594430,"post_url":"http://hiddenbeneaththisshame.tumblr.com/post/97115594430/day-by-day-i-continue-the-battle-taking-on-more","slug":"day-by-day-i-continue-the-battle-taking-on-more","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 04:28:00 GMT","timestamp":1410323280,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"5e5uB8hL","tags":["poetry","lgbtqia","trans","transguy","ftm"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZLE5xm1QSYbw_","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"caption":"\"day by day I continue the battle,\n\ntaking on more everyday its getting worse.\n\nthey all throw me down to the gravel,\n\nour beliefs so adverse..\n\nI’ll still rise up like a dark horse.”","image_permalink":"http://hiddenbeneaththisshame.tumblr.com/image/97115594430","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1200,"height":1600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1200,"height":1600,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/9078843c8507d963f91ca84c0e2b3795/tumblr_nbo4f3d4O71thbdfao1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"livingtrans","id":97114714759,"post_url":"http://livingtrans.tumblr.com/post/97114714759/things-to-start-off-with","slug":"things-to-start-off-with","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 04:14:46 GMT","timestamp":1410322486,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"EUDCDHri","tags":["Trans","Cis","bff","life"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z6mxWm1QSVFA7","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Things to start off with...","body":"I am me.

I truly appreciate it. I’d gotten to a very bad place last night when I woke up in the middle of the night racked with anxiety.\n\nI’m still quite anxious, but today was a mostly good day. Last night’s sleeplessness made for a foggy start. I’d notified my team I’d be working from home today, but I found myself instantly overwhelmed when I checked email this morning. A dear friend invited me to go out for lunch today, and seeing her made a huge difference in the trajectory of my day. I know she didn’t expect the downer dump I ended up laying on her, and I truly hope our lunches together don’t become a place where I cry on her shoulder every time. Figuratively of course, we all know I can’t cry (even though I want to). This friendship has become a very valuable thing to me, and I don’t want to f it up. She invited me to come over to her place for dinner tomorrow and she’s going to start to teach me how to knit. I’m super excited! Her husband always jokes that their house is like a talk show, and I’m grateful to be tomorrow’s featured guest.\n\nLunch was super duper gender affirming, and when I got home I put on one of my favorite dresses and started working. Got a bunch of stupid but important stuff done, and had a productive conference call with some other vendors that we’re partnering up with to do a project for big-ass, Fortune something-something client. I am seriously dreading wearing guy dress-up clothes and driving my ass to Houston next week. Ugh.\n\nAfter the call ended I took care of a few emails, put on some make-up and went to my weekly trans psychotherapy group. I had a lot to share this week, and I received a lot of empathy, understanding, and positive vibes. Group has been and continues to be one of the best things that has ever happening to me. And I received compliments on my outfit, which while seemingly shallow, was actually very nice.

I’m that vintage and I loved the New Kids On The Block back when I should have been wearing acid wash guess jeans, pony tails, hair bows, reading seventeen, indulging in other terrible fashion trends and talking with friends on my phone tethered to the wall. \n\nInstead I was the girl hiding from everyone but still listening to NKOTB, only in my case with headphones so to keep to myself. \n\nOne evening in the privacy of my own room I tried to steal a moment for myself to be real. I was rocking to Hanging Tough, it just happened to be the song at the moment. I was singing out loud even though no one else could hear the music playing. My sister walked in on me and caught me singing to her favorite band. I don’t even know if she knew I listened to them before that time, I hid well.\n\nEither way, she laughed, I did too, I was embarrassed but it wasn’t a bad moment. I just thought I was alone. Kind of like when you are caught dancing by yourself and for yourself, you might be startled and embarrassed but it’s not a big deal. I don’t remember much else about that night. I do remember the solitude of my room, the comfort I found there. Sometimes I felt safe enough to peak out and take a look around, in this case singing along to NKOTB as a thirteen year old girl.\n\nSo I told her this memory not even an hour ago by text and she remembered it well. I said, “that was me.” I think something happened to us both. I cried, I think she teared up. We had a moment. We had a moment that connected our new sisterhood to our unknown past sisterhood.\n\nWe can’t read seventeen together or talk about boys, or complain about the mean girls or help each other with the struggles of early fashion and the pressure to be cool, what to say and who to be friends with and all the drama as we both emerge from childhood into our teens, but we can still be sisters even if we missed the dress rehearsal.\n\nWe still are sisters and now we have a memory of our past to share and to build upon as we take on the current challenges of parenthood, marriage, career and life together. \n\nI love you.\n\n-brunette","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"radiowiresoverthesea","id":97110168919,"post_url":"http://radiowiresoverthesea.tumblr.com/post/97110168919/i-just-want-to-give-a-shoutout-to-some-transmen","slug":"i-just-want-to-give-a-shoutout-to-some-transmen","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 03:12:36 GMT","timestamp":1410318756,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"EFTe61Yz","tags":["transgender","ftm","transguy","trans","transman"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZH5pmw1QSDvLN","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"title":"","body":"I just want to give a shoutout to some transmen.

He works for Bon Secours, a medical care charity/chain thing of sorts. It’s a Catholic organization, but they hire people outside of their religious beliefs. In fact, I’d say a good majority of the people that work for them are not Catholic. Anyway, they’ve recently decided that since they are a religious organization they don’t have to provide contraceptives to their employees. Luckily the ACA says everyone needs access to covered contraceptives. But now I have to have a separate insurance card specifically for contraceptives so that it is absolutely clear that Bon Secours is not paying for them. Every time I use that card, I’m going to think about what a terrible organization they are.\n\nBut the problems don’t end there. Last year when my husband was inquiring about whether or not my specific brand of contraceptive would be covered, the response he was given was “well you don’t qualify for contraceptives” (they were obviously assuming he was a cis male with the “normal” male genitalia without even thinking about it). Wow such cisnormativity…\n\nThen today, when the women in the clinic were talking about the contraceptive change. My husband knew nothing about it. He got no notifications. Even though he has a dependent with a uterus that requires contraceptives. Even though Bon Secours has no fucking reason to believe that he WOULDN’T need to know about this change since it’s not like they keep tabs on what employees’ genitals look like and how they function.\n\nBut then they turn around and pretend that they care about the LGBTQIA+ community through their little HRC (hah, yeah) videos and shit that I don’t really think half the people take seriously (especially employees say things like the “christian in them” won’t let them treat someone different from them badly, as if that is the only thing holding them back from being a complete asshole). If I was working for them, I would be marching my ass down to HR and reporting a hostile work environment for people with uteri and trans people. Because this whole thing is just bullshit. The whole organization is full to the brim with bullshit. “Good Help” my ass.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"exhale-the-darkness","id":97104553653,"post_url":"http://exhale-the-darkness.tumblr.com/post/97104553653/bath-time","slug":"bath-time","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 02:03:48 GMT","timestamp":1410314628,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"vJjrWcZo","tags":["ftm","trans","transgender","transman","transguy","tattoos"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zlc1yv1QRuUQr","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"caption":"Bath time.","image_permalink":"http://exhale-the-darkness.tumblr.com/image/97104553653","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":758,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":296,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":237,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":148,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":59,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":758,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/27821fe89090cc7888c0e641fa2b0b5b/tumblr_nbnxqcqteG1rpa3vyo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"k-con","id":97104228677,"post_url":"http://k-con.tumblr.com/post/97104228677/193-days-post-op","slug":"193-days-post-op","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 01:59:54 GMT","timestamp":1410314394,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"ba1M9ltj","tags":["top surgery","queer","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zvndbw1QRtF55","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":10,"caption":"193 days post-op.","image_permalink":"http://k-con.tumblr.com/image/97104228677","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/105c85693f89616189119300dcfc9cf6/tumblr_nbnxjub0vL1r65qdoo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"trans-parenting","id":97104190720,"post_url":"http://trans-parenting.tumblr.com/post/97104190720/with-being-trans-is-sex-weird-for-you-have-you-ever","slug":"with-being-trans-is-sex-weird-for-you-have-you-ever","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-10 01:59:00 GMT","timestamp":1410314340,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"fuJpZtMz","tags":["transparenting","trans","transgender","trans relationships","me","questions","Anonymous"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZnO4pr1QRt5q0","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":16,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"with being trans, is sex weird for you? have you ever felt like having a sex change? were you trans before meeting your wife? does your wife call you her wife?","answer":"I will answer these in reverse, because, reasons!\n\nMy wife calls me her partner, just as I call her my partner.

I have done my research, and I am just not interested in pursuing a full medical transition. I have absolutely had days where I have wondered if a social transition with (or without) hormones might be the right path for me, but for now this is where I am…somewhere in a fuzzy middle-ground. It works.\nI do not go too many into (personal) details about sex on here most of the time, but yeah, as a trans person there can definitely be some extra layers when it comes to my gender identity/body dysphoria and intimacy.

much about otherkin identities and I’m not so? So my knowledge is limited. But y’all seem okay to me.\n\nI’m not sure about a connection between otherkin and gender? Other than that a bunch of trans, and specifically non-binary…folks (???) also identify as otherkin? And I think I read somewhere that it’s connected to spirituality for some…but that’s about all I know.\n\nAnd I always call bullshit so hard on the belief that trans people have to be a certain kind of way for our identities to be respected. It’s not our burden to be acceptable enough to others in our existence, and definitely not as a requirement for such things as basic respect and healthcare.\n\nSo, I would say: what actually makes it hard for trans people to be respected and access trans related healthcare is the prejudices and cissexism, racism, ableism, etc of cis people and medical industry gatekeepers.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"pre-post-modernism","id":97098695582,"post_url":"http://pre-post-modernism.tumblr.com/post/97098695582/h-m-short-shorts-forever-21-sweatshirt","slug":"h-m-short-shorts-forever-21-sweatshirt","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 00:49:26 GMT","timestamp":1410310166,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"mSWMaEoS","tags":["selfie","nonbinary","genderqueer","trans","paper towels only","love this sweatshirt omg","short shorts"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZDS2Yo1QRY8EU","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"H & M short shorts & Forever 21 sweatshirt","image_permalink":"http://pre-post-modernism.tumblr.com/image/97098695582","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":987,"height":987,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":500,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":250,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":987,"height":987,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/e4905ae6dce08538897da0750507dd5c/tumblr_nbnuaenSwq1trz9z7o1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"minementis","id":97098646099,"post_url":"http://minementis.tumblr.com/post/97098646099/one-of-my-cousins-just-messaged-me-on-fb-and-she","slug":"one-of-my-cousins-just-messaged-me-on-fb-and-she","type":"text","date":"2014-09-10 00:48:50 GMT","timestamp":1410310130,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"HwH07BI5","tags":["gender","coming out","non binary","trans","family","I'm so happy rn that was the best thing to see after a long day","hello darling here comes the sun"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zg3fFx1QRXy9J","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":7,"title":"","body":"One of my cousins just messaged me on fb and she actually googled about my gender stuff and looked on my tumblr page to learn more about me and she’s super nice about it and !!!!!!!!

This podcast is the celebration of not only our 50th episode, but our 2nd year anniversary! We invited back some of the guests we’ve had on the show in the past to join us for a round table discussion where everyone brings a topic to the table and we go around the room and discuss it. Our guests include Trans counselors, Dara Hoffman-Fox, and Jan Scott-Frazier. A transgender atheist, Maddy Love. Our always altruistic, Bunny. Podcast pal, August. Fellow co-host, Ramona Knotts. And your host, transgender writer, Amber Neko Meador.\n\nJoin us as we discuss topics including:\n\n-How do I know if I’m trans?\n-How to respond to social media attacks?\n-Were we born boys, girls, or babys?\n-How is trans representation in the media changing?\n-How does one become a good trans ally?\n-How does one adjust/cope/make peace with being transgender and belonging to a religion or church?\n-Coming out advice and thoughts?\n-And what about third gender options? Or fourth? Or fifth?\n\nSo join us for a long, but very interesting podcast as we go around the room and discuss what’s on our minds :)\n\nwww.transitiontransmission.com\n@TransgenderTrio\n\nRuntime: 3 HOURS","player":"<embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://assets.tumblr.com/swf/audio_player.swf?audio_file=http%3A%2F%2Ftraffic.libsyn.com%2Ftransitiontransmission%2Fttep050.mp3&color=FFFFFF\" height=\"27\" width=\"207\" quality=\"best\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed>","embed":"<iframe class=\"tumblr_audio_player tumblr_audio_player_97095946861\" src=\"http://transitiontransmission.com/post/97095946861/audio_player_iframe/transitiontransmission/tumblr_nbnc2jhQ4M1rge4f6?audio_file=http%3A%2F%2Ftraffic.libsyn.com%2Ftransitiontransmission%2Fttep050.mp3\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"500\" height=\"169\"></iframe>","plays":14,"audio_url":"http://traffic.libsyn.com/transitiontransmission/ttep050.mp3","audio_type":"tumblr","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"freethisman","id":97095927119,"post_url":"http://freethisman.tumblr.com/post/97095927119/i-wanted-to-celebrate-the-fact-that-im-followed","slug":"i-wanted-to-celebrate-the-fact-that-im-followed","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-10 00:12:16 GMT","timestamp":1410307936,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"M92HamPI","tags":["ftm","ftm transgender","trans","pre-t"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZQ-Xjm1QRNaLF","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"caption":"I wanted to celebrate the fact that I’m followed by my wonderful psy since three months now, that I am back at school and that September is probably my last month pre-T :)\n\nCandies, cheap beer and “old” video games :D \n\nThe appointment with the doc is next Monday.

Mount Holyoke president Lynn Pasquerella made the decision public during an emotional speech as part of the college’s convocation.\n\n\"We recognize that what it means to be a woman is not static … We acknowledge that gender identity is not reducible to the body,\" Pasquerella said in the speech, appearing to wipe away tears. \"Our new policy formally welcomes applications from … anyone who is female or who identifies as a woman.\"\n\nPasquerella clarified that Mount Holyoke needed a “formal policy” that would “articulate our commitment to core values of individual freedom, social justice and diversity and inclusion.” The college, she said, “has welcomed trans students in the past and for several years ha[s] been in conversation with campus constituencies about how best to foster a respectful environment for all students.” But it was still important for university administrators to send a clear, welcoming message to the trans community.\n\nThe change in policy comes amidst a tense debate within feminism about transgender inclusion. In her speech, Pasquerella referenced the thinking of mainstream feminists, who decades ago argued against biological determinism in order to gain societal advancement. This logic, she observed, can be similarly applied to the decision to accept applications from all students.\n\nSo far, the new policy has received unanimous support from the LGBT community, which has called for women’s colleges to open its doors to trans students in recent years. While they have generally been considered bastions of the liberal arts, women’s colleges have stayed surprisingly conservative in their understanding of gender when it comes to their admissions policies. Some cite the red herring of Title IX which, up until this summer, provided a loophole to women’s colleges regarding their single sex status. The Department of Education has since extended protections to trans students.\n\nThe issue attracted national attention last year, after Calliope Wong was denied admission into Smith College due to a so-called “gender inconsistency” in her application. The Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) identified her as male, and this inconsistency effectively nullified her candidacy. “Your FAFSA,” read Wong’s rejection letter, “indicates your gender as male. Therefore, Smith cannot process your application.”\n\ncontinued…","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"aerinisababe","id":97093000192,"post_url":"http://aerinisababe.tumblr.com/post/97093000192/i-know-there-was-a-post-going-around-a-little","slug":"i-know-there-was-a-post-going-around-a-little","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 23:32:06 GMT","timestamp":1410305526,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"it7dJk2g","tags":["trans","transgender"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zc_Ukt1QRCPm0","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"title":"","body":"i know there was a post going around a little while ago that was like an outline for trans students to give to their teachers informing them about their pronouns and stuff. does anybody have a link to that??","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"peter-in-nag","id":97092908093,"post_url":"http://peter-in-nag.tumblr.com/post/97092908093","slug":"","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 23:30:48 GMT","timestamp":1410305448,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"oqN90N8V","tags":["nasrid palace","alhambra","espania","lgbt","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zwr30t1QRC3Gz","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"caption":"","image_permalink":"http://peter-in-nag.tumblr.com/image/97092908093","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":720,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":281,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":225,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":141,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":56,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":720,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6ee54455da5880edbcf5eea4a488f0ed/tumblr_nbmvb3Tb4p1s5m7vno1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":"Samsung NX300","ISO":3200,"Aperture":"f/3.5","Exposure":"1/15th","FocalLength":"18mm"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"cuntofdoom","id":97092776077,"post_url":"http://cuntofdoom.tumblr.com/post/97092776077/queer-trans-femme-hottie-selfie-vanity","slug":"queer-trans-femme-hottie-selfie-vanity","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 23:29:03 GMT","timestamp":1410305343,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"jGyqOKX9","tags":["selfie","queer","hottie","vanity","trans","femme"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZazyTy1QRBZ2D","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"#queer #trans #femme #hottie #selfie #vanity","link_url":"http://instagram.com/p/svkNIXvFpI/","image_permalink":"http://cuntofdoom.tumblr.com/image/97092776077","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":500,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":250,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/8b3c225786f49615c97eaa90cbc8683a/tumblr_nbnqkg2Lo01qaqn6jo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"christoph5712","id":97092680553,"post_url":"http://christoph5712.tumblr.com/post/97092680553/thankful-for-the-nhs","slug":"thankful-for-the-nhs","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 23:27:49 GMT","timestamp":1410305269,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"cEs1OehF","tags":["ftm","trans","transgender","surgery","hysto","hysterectomy","hormones","NHS","Private","cost","Money"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZQmZpt1QRBBjf","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"title":"Thankful for the NHS","body":"I have just been doing a bit of research with my up coming Hysto consultation.

My suggestions are probably ones you have already thought of, but: are there ways you can pick up extra work/hours? Someone understanding who you can get a loan (full or partial) from? Odd jobs you can do (animal watching? yardwork? whatever?)? Gofundme? Camming? There are obviously pros and cons to each.\n\nI am no expert on packers, but $1K+ definitely strikes me as expensive. Not saying it is not the right one by any means, but is there any way you can manage with a lesser/cheaper packer while you save up for the perfect one? Might help ease the waiting process a little.\n\nTake my advice with a grain of salt though, my breast forms are on the cheap side…but hey, only Navyy and I get to/have to see them, so it does not bother me.

I’ve got a show with lots of new spoken word poetry about LGBT, Queer, Trans, and Asian American themes and would love to share them! This year in addition to a full length show, I’ve got TWO workshops I’m touring- an open-level slam poetry writing and performance workshop and an advanced level workshop for teams and active poetry crews! I’m excited to be offering these because I’ve found that after I give a workshop on a campus folks have been self organizing events that include more student poetry exhibitions and excursions.

Still feel free to get in contact with me if you write for a blog or something and would be interested in a free PDF in exchange for a review. \n\nThe pre-ordered copies will be going out in a few weeks. Official paperback release date is October 1st. \n\nI am proud of this book. I wasn’t sure about it until I neared the end, and it became clear to me. I feel it will be very important. I don’t say that to be arrogant, just confident. As Morrissey said in his first TV interview. “If you really have something and you’re very sure of it, why hide?” I hope everybody will check it out. I’ll post again with a link when it’s available to purchase. \n\nAbout Show Trans: A nonfiction novel about sex addiction, sex work, navigating the MSM scene, a trip West, dissociative identity disorder, and the struggle to find love, connection, and self-actualization as a non-binary trans person. This book will be my most autobiographical (and arguably scandalous) work to date.

You are pretty awesome.\n\nCrowdfunding for trans-related care (hair removal/surgeries/therapy/etc.) seems to be pretty common these days, which is maybe both a good reminder of how cool the internet can be and just how crappy healthcare coverage is for this sort of care. But I am glad that option is out there for people, cool stuff.\n\nThat said, I feel a little hesitant about accepting money from other people for this stuff for me. I may not be as financially comfortable as I would like to be, but I do have a good job and with a little budgeting and the help of Groupon this seems pretty attainable with my current means. I appreciate the offer and generosity, and maybe it is just my own desire to help others first, but my inclination is to say that there are people more in need of the help.

article written in my school paper about Gender Dysphoria and I’m PISSED. While I understand this is an Op/Ed piece and the author is entitled to her own opinion, the first paragraph especially is hate speech. She is uneducated on the topic and I want this kind of uneducated bullshit to stop being published, especially when my school has a large LGBT presence and support. Please boost the shit out of this. Comment on the page. Make them know that hate speech will not be tolerated.\n\n\"In a land of freedom, controversy proceeds. While some new scandalous trend is emerging every day, there’s one particular LGBT (famed for their questionable morals) fad that is hitting the surface: transgendered children.\n\nThis one has republicans dazed and confused and parents wrapped in knots. Children as young as five years old are being given the chance to choose which gender they’d like to mirror. In this, parents allow their daughters or sons to wear the opposite sex clothing, and they take further measures to present the appropriate gender’s style, i.e. long or short hair, or in older ages, makeup.\n\nIt’s arguable to say that there should be no borderline for people and what they do, and all should be able to choose what they wear and do with their hair and faces limitlessly, but it is clear that parents and their children are going for choosing between a boy or a girl for their everyday life. In fact, in ages as young as eleven, parents have taken steps to insuring that puberty is stinted for their children by administering a certain drug. For Dr. Olson, a specialist in this bizarre condition in Los Angeles, it is called ‘Supprelin.’\n\n‘Supprelin’ is an implant that goes in the arm and provides enough hormones to block puberty for a year. It’s a thin, inch-long capsule filled with the hormone stuff. With this, girls who long to be boys may avoid developing breasts and other methods of maturation, and boys wanting to be girls evade facial hair and other pubescent nuances.\n\nThis growing swell of children who seek early gender reassignment suffer from a dysfunction known as “gender dysphoria.”\n\nAccording to the DSM, gender dysphoria is the “conflict between a person’s physical gender and the gender he or she identifies as.”\n\nDr. Olson tells CBS News that the number of people with this odd condition has had a 330 percent increase over the year of 2013. Estimated, it effects 0.5 percent of the adult population, or 700,000 Americans.\n\nWho’s to say why this condition is suddenly poking its head? Is it a matter of more children being born with this dysfunction? Is it something in our food or something in our lifestyle? Or is it merely the way of life morphing into that of a more accepting one? With the growing LGBT support, with numerous allies all across the world, it could be that people who had long suffered with this condition are coming out of the woodworks, and in turn encouraging children to do the same. Our young people are being taught that it’s most important to feel comfortable in your own skin, despite the repercussions.\n\nIn reported cases of gender dysphoria, 89 percent of children experience harassment at school or other social venues. Most children wouldn’t voluntarily choose to be picked on, so who’s to say that these kids actually have a choice as to what skin they live in? This couldn’t be some game to them if it meant risking any friendships they once had to be the black sheep.\n\nMany agree that the parents are to blame, as well. But according to Cristy and Enrique, who let their son dress as a girl at six years old, they felt they had no choice.\n\n“She was in pain,” she tells Braver with CBS News. “I don’t see that there was another option. She was uncomfortable, she was unhappy. You can’t see your child suffer like that.”\n\nHundreds of families like Cristy and Enrique’s will undergo this problem with their children.

I do have (admittedly vague) plans to come out to my coworkers/boss within the next year on at least the level of, “you should know this about me,” and I hope to within the much nearer future have that same conversation with our LGBTQ staff director.\n\nJust presenting female at work, while it might go alright, certainly invites more potential for problems with mismatched gender/legal name/bathroom/etc. issues as distinct possibilities. As far as I am concerned if I decide to present female at work I might as well just fully (socially) transition, ie. present female full time, even if I did nothing else in the way of hormones/surgery/etc. That way, with the approval of an understanding judge and/or doctor, I could also get the legal name changes/gender marker changes that would make it smoother logistically. I have a progressive employer where it would not be an issue if I got all my ducks in a row, but if I went that route I would want to make sure it was as seamless as possible.\n\nFor now, I am not particularly compelled to do that, but it is good to have that option available if that is what I need to be more authentically me.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sinlapinthai","id":97069725467,"post_url":"http://sinlapinthai.tumblr.com/post/97069725467/hormones-gangs-funny-conversation","slug":"hormones-gangs-funny-conversation","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 18:06:48 GMT","timestamp":1410286008,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"b6Sobx7P","tags":["Kao Supassra","Peach Pachara","March Chutavuth","top napat","trans","lol","don't know why I did this","but it's really funny","and I have a feeling that my english would make their convo less funny",";_____;","wish you guy could understand Thai","sorry if there is any mistake"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zauthx1QPpdSR","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":12,"title":"Hormones Gang's Funny Conversation","body":"supassra_bliss: Finance!!! :’( Kill me, please.

I understand a little better now. There's just one thing I don't get, the non binary. I've seen one of you is non binary so could you please explain it a bit more in depth?

(Also sorry for any possible English mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.)","answer":"Men and women are binary genders, binary meaning “relating to, composed of, or involving two things.”. For a long time gender has been considered binary except for in a few cultures that have third genders based off gender roles. However, in most cases, these genders aren’t considered trans due to the facts that they’re based on gender roles and that third gender members of the cultures have asked to not be considered trans.\n\nNon binary is a word to describe trans people whose gender is not the two binary genders (man and woman).\n\nAgender and bigender are non binary genders.\n\nNon binary people face a unique set of problems specific to them. While trans men and women are gaining visibility and acceptance, though at a slow pace, and have hormone therapy and surgeries available to them, there is currently very little visibility for non binary people, a lot of gender therapist are unaware of non binary genders, and little to no research has been done for hormone therapy and surgeries for them.\n\nAlso, trans people are considered freaks by a lot of people and even more people consider it freakish to desire no sex characteristics or characteristics of both sexes.\n\n  \n\nI’ve personally looked up the possibilities for agender people and came across a story of someone who wished to neutralize the sex characteristics of their body but was instead pushed into a full transition to female instead.\n\nI’ve asked people about it as well and been blown off with a “why would you want to mutilate your perfectly fine body?”\n\nI’m hoping as binary trans people get more recognition, non binary trans people will as well.\n\n(you’re not coming off as rude at all!

There’s only one problem with Maxine—she already has a girlfriend, perfect Becky.\n\nJayla quickly falls under Maxine’s spell, and she’s willing to do anything to win her. But when Becky turns up dead, Jayla is pulled into a tangle of deceit, lies, and murder. Now Jayla is forced to choose between love and the truth.\n\n Jayla will need all the strength she has to escape the darkness that threatens to take her very life.\n\nReview: This book is so refreshing! It features a lesbian trans lead, with a sassy bi trans best friend. The writing is really tight and focussed and the background of the characters transition is explained quickly without seeming like an info-dump. \n\nThe story starts at a queer prom, after an intriguing flashforward prologue. I love how the story shows trans people how to deal with unwanted attention and awkward questions about their body and gender, which is something that can be really useful for teenagers.\n\nOverall this seems to be a trans story with a lot of potential! Definitely worth a read. \n\n3/5 stars","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"samaeloliver","id":97066456726,"post_url":"http://samaeloliver.tumblr.com/post/97066456726/my-new-boss-saw-on-my-facebook-that-im-hoping-to","slug":"my-new-boss-saw-on-my-facebook-that-im-hoping-to","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 17:09:55 GMT","timestamp":1410282595,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"Tg90WvCm","tags":["trans","transgender","nonbinary","top surgery"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZdU-sv1QPd9QM","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"My new boss saw on my Facebook that I’m hoping to get top surgery soon and is trying really hard to be inclusive… Which I really love and appreciate, especially on the pronoun front, but she just gave me an article that she took out of a magazine, directed toward women with best cancer getting mastectomies or preventative mastectomies, and coping with the physical and emotional changes. \n\nIt’s just kind of silly because like— I researched the shit out of top surgery the second I realized I wanted it even though I knew I wasn’t getting it anytime in the foreseeable future, and the things the article said were very very basic, and didn’t fully apply cause it was advice for people who didn’t particularly want to have their breasts removed!! \n\nI’m glad that she thinking of me but it was a little embarrassing lol.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"vfpatlas","id":97066387441,"post_url":"http://vfpatlas.tumblr.com/post/97066387441/omg-did-you-know-soy-contains-high-amounts-of","slug":"omg-did-you-know-soy-contains-high-amounts-of","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 17:08:46 GMT","timestamp":1410282526,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"hkG71j0m","tags":["soy","estrogen","mtf","trans","lgbtq","hormones"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z-tKbp1QPcuVn","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":41,"title":"","body":"OMG DID YOU KNOW SOY CONTAINS HIGH AMOUNTS OF ESTROGEN I DID NOT KNOW THAT THAT’S SO WEIRD\n\nMight come in handy for any mtf out there","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"ellen-is-on-oestrogen","id":97066338804,"post_url":"http://ellen-is-on-oestrogen.tumblr.com/post/97066338804/why-would-you-argue-against-self-medication","slug":"why-would-you-argue-against-self-medication","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-09 17:07:50 GMT","timestamp":1410282470,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"d5CLm6zH","tags":["transgender","trans","healthcare","self-medication","HRT","DIY HRT","Anonymous","ask auntie ellen"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZwIxis1QPcidq","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":5,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"Why would you argue against self-medication?","answer":"If you read my article, you’ll find I’m not.

In times gone by (and still to this date, at some clinics), healthcare providers have required trans people to navigate ridiculous and unreasonable obstacles before being granted access to treatment. Requiring stereotypical gender presentation, being “out” to everyone prior to treatment, “Real Life Experience” (the requirement to change gender presentation prior to treatment, a practice that still exists and puts patients in danger), insistence upon gender-nonconforming career changes, unhelpful mental healthcare and the rejection of patients seen to be “not trans enough” are just a few of the historical problems with GICs. \n\nI don’t think we talk about self-medication in the trans community nearly enough. In a UK context, the fact that self-medication still exists shows big problems with the healthcare system, and addressing the need to self-medicate is useful for addressing larger problems in GICs and gender services as a whole.\n\nI wrote this in a short span, and although I’m not happy with it, I’m out of things to say on the issue right now. Self-medication is (rightly so) a controversial issue, but I don’t think ignoring it does any good, and nor does outright condemning it.\n\nLike everything, middle grounds can be useful.\n\nHave a read, sure!

Those youngsters dressed in Hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) having Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) ahead were BTS! Live broadcast of ‘slightly dangerous Korean Thanksgiving Day’ which was prepared with STARCAST also went on. They seem to be noisy only by looking at the picture! We release ‘Live broadcast of the behind story’ now.\n\n\"Are you guys STARCAST? We’re BTS!\" \n\nThe youngest of BTS, JUNG KOOK took in charge of the live broadcast VJ! He showed great emceeing skill in the ‘BANGTAN NEWS’ at the jacket album shooting, right? He has growing into an ‘indigenous VJ’ of BTS like this. Besides, September 1st was his 18th birthday. (We give you belated birthday greetings again!) \n\n\"18-year-old JUNG KOOK! Please grow like just like now~\"\n\nThe future ‘indigenous VJ’ seems to be slightly nervous at the live broadcast. Other members that worried him keep on looking into the cue card gave strength to him by shouting out, “JUNG KOOK! Trust us!” But did I only feel that their voices were also trembling…?\n\n\"Are you nervous, the youngest? I’m also too”\n\n\"The youngest should emcee well…\"\n\nVJ JUNG KOOK brightly smiled as if he feels relaxed now. They are taking picture and warming up before shooting the live broadcast earnestly.\n\n“When you laugh I’m also happy~”\n\n\"Welcome, it’s the first time seeing the live broadcast of ‘BTS flower youngsters’, right?\"\n\nV who kept on taking set-shots started to eat when the broadcast started. He kept on slurping in banana, peach and Songpyeon (Korean half-moon-shaped rice cake) that were prepared as props~ \n\n\"The reason why I have both hands is to eat with them both!\"\n\nWe prepared time to wish at the super moon at the broadcast this day. “Moon moon~ bright moon~” \n\n“Please wish when the full moon appears”\n\n\"♬Our wish is going on a vacation♬” V is crying out for the unforgettable vacation. PD Bang, are you seeing this? V performed awkward crying acting! It is said that producer Hitman Bang, gave BTS Chuseok holidays by getting touched by awkward V’s acting. \n\n\"Please give us holidays~ or I will keep on acting awkwardly~.\"\n\nThe point of this live broadcast was ‘Danger’ choreography performed by dressed up in Hanbok! They performed ‘Danger’ choreography by fluttering their sleeves and trousers. They smartly finished the dance by giving a shout of concentration as if they were having hard time dressed up in layers of Hanbok. Please check the replay video those who have missed the live broadcast~\n\nBTS burnt up the live broadcast whitely by performing ‘Danger’ choreography. They ended the live broadcast by making a deep bow to fans.\n\n“Have a great Chuseok this year too~”\n\nChuseok has come back more early than ordinary years. Although the autumn atmosphere cannot be felt much, the weather has become much cooler. Have you all wished to the moon high up in the skies? BTS spent happy time with their families by getting holidays and wished to the moon. Please spend the rest of the holiday well, and let’s meet again at the next week’s STARCAST. \n\n“Have a happy Chuseok~”\n\nWait a moment here! Can you remember the pledge which BTS promised during the live broadcast? They said they would give out the signed dolls they were hugging as presents~ If you leave comments about how you felt about BTS performing ‘Danger’ choreography dressed up in Hanboks, we will give them out to 2 people from draws!

More after the break, if you care to read. \n\n<!-- more -->\n\n  My Speech professor is an older guy, and a longtime theater professional. He’s performed all over the world, with a ton of very prestigious companies. Therefore, he’s a very intimidating presence in my campus’ theater department. Phil is the kind of person who you would grovel to get his approval, and probably cry if he ever got mad at you. I was thoroughly scared to have a class with him this semester, but I knew as long as I did the work and applied myself, it should totally go okay. \n\n  Well, I discovered that Phil has a very strange way of trying to include everyone. He’s making an effort not to be sexist - which I can totally appreciate - when he says things like ‘ladies and gentlemen’ and things like that. Turns out he was completely ignorant to the category of ‘other’ than I and other non-binary students fall into. \n\n  One day last week, he said something about ‘ladies and gentlemen,’ and for whatever reason, went onto a tangent (as he’s prone to do) about all the million ways one can say ‘ladies and gentlemen.’ I felt so uncomfortable; I’d honestly never wanted to leave a classroom as badly as I did right then. But I took a deep breath, steeled myself, and just chimed up “or others!”\n\n  He stopped, sort of cocked his head, and said, “What does that mean?” \n\n  I said, “Like trans people. Not everyone fits into ladies and gentlemen.” \n\n  He then told us a story about a trans woman actress he used to work with, doing his best to use correct pronouns (something I can sort of excuse - he’s an older gentleman, I give him credit for working to correct himself), and told us that she played “the best Richard III I’d ever seen.” It was a clue that I could continue and correct him to what I was speaking about. \n\n  ”Yes, that’s important, but I was talking more about non-binary trans people.”\n\n  He naturally gave me a look of confusion, having never heard the term before. So I explained in a very general sense what the phrase could mean and the people that could use it, and explained how I personally use it. Now, mind you, this was in front of my whole class, which is a small core of about 12 people that I’ll be spending the rest of my college career with - my voice was shaking and I wanted to throw up. \n\n  However, Phil just sat back, listened patiently, and thanked me for bringing it up. He apologized, saying, “I’m sorry that anything I’ve said has made you uncomfortable, that’s not at all my intention.” And I accepted his apology, told him it was really only that day. \n\n  We continued on with class, and I went home. I felt pretty good about the whole scenario; he had seemed genuinely interested in what I was saying, had agreed to work on using my preferred pronouns, and the class seemed to also show a lot of support. Any sick feeling I had had dissapated, and it was really validating to have found a professor who genuinely cares - I know that’s actually pretty rare to find. \n\n  The next day, I was walking into my morning class and I got a text from Phil. He was thanking me again for bringing something up, and told me that he had been doing research on his own all night the previous evening. I almost started crying in the middle of the hallway - he has no investment in me or non-binary trans people, he doesn’t really have to care, but since I introduced him to it he took it upon himself to seek information. He genuinely wanted to make his classroom better for me and for any student like me who might follow. I was overwhelmed, and I texted him back with a profuse gratitude. I also mentioned that I have a ‘zine written by the amazing Ollie Schminkey, full of information and resources for instructors with trans students. He was so excited and wanted me to email it over to him as soon as I could. \n\n  Well, funny thing. For whatever reason, I kept getting error messages that said the file was too big. The whole weekend went by and I couldn’t get it to him or think of a way to link him to this .pdf on my computer. \n\n  When we walked into class yesterday, he said his hellos and then looked at me with a little point and head nod of ‘oh, I just remembered!’ He asked me about the ‘zine, and if I had sent it. I told him I was having troubles, and he sat with me for about 10 minutes, sending test emails, making sure I had the right address, and eventually came up with a solution to get the ‘zine to him. After class, he even pulled me aside and asked for my help to brainstorm better ways to speak, and very respectfully asked what he had said that bothered me so he could eliminate it. I gave him a huge hug before I left, almost wanting to cry out of joy again.\n\n  I’ll be hearing from him probably tomorrow about the ‘zine, and any other questions he was left with after reading it. I guess I just wanted to write this to let people know that coming out, talking about things you have problems with, and asking for respect isn’t as terrifying as I think most of us believe it is. I knew it could have gone horribly wrong. I know that there are quite a few of my professors that I couldn’t have that kind of conversation with. However, I was stunned to find out that things could also be so positive. I’m still a little in disbelief over the fact that someone I barely knew devoted an evening to research, and actively working to get a better understanding on my situation that didn’t involve drilling me with a million questions. \n\n  Don’t be afraid to demand the things you deserve. Don’t be so petrified by the fear of everything that could go wrong that you never find out if it could be great. \n\n  And thank you again to Phil Hubbard, probably the best teacher I’ve ever encountered. \n\n  For anyone else that wants the ‘zine: I have a .pdf on my computer that I would absolutely be willing to send out. It’s very well-written and is full of other links, resources, and ‘further reading,’ written by the brilliant Ollie Schminkey. They’re one of the leading queer activists and poets, who attend Macalaster University and runs the slam poetry team there. They have one published book of poems, and they’re featured in an anthology compiled by Andrea Gibson. They’re the best of the best and would love the ‘zine to be distributed. If you’d like it, shoot me a message with your email and I’ll send you a Dropbox link, and you can use it to send to your professors before the semester (or during!) as an aid in coming out and asking for your preferred name/pronouns.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"trans-parenting","id":97061557705,"post_url":"http://trans-parenting.tumblr.com/post/97061557705/wondering-why-you-arent-interested-in-a-sex-change","slug":"wondering-why-you-arent-interested-in-a-sex-change","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-09 15:43:04 GMT","timestamp":1410277384,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"8M5QvYbT","tags":["transparenting","trans","transgender","surgery","gender identity","gender dysphoria","questions","Anonymous"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZnO4pr1QPKTN9","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":33,"asking_name":"Anonymous","asking_url":null,"question":"Wondering why you arent interested in a sex change?","answer":"Because for me it is not worth it.\n\nI am really glad gender confirmation surgery options exist for trans people who need them - and I am a huge advocate for making them more accessible and affordable. That said, they are not for me.\n\nMore after a break, because, genitals, oh my!\n\n[[MORE]]\n\nGender confirmation surgery (aka. sexual reassignment surgery…or a “sex change”) is expensive - like thousands or tens of thousands of dollars expensive (often not covered by insurance). You have to jump through a number of medical hoops to make it a possibility, and like any major surgery there can be complications - it is not uncommon to have at least some loss of sensation, and that is not even taking into account what impact it can have on relationships. Trust me, the people who are seeking this surgery really need it.\n\nI do not. I have come to terms with having a penis, and I feel like the trade-offs are simply not worth it. I do not see myself as any less “trans” or any less “feminine” because of it.\n\nTo put it another way, from a recent Huffington Post article by Justin Ropella: \n\nSurgery is absolutely not a requirement for or condition of trans*ness. For some people gender-confirmation surgery is a personal necessity, a life-or-death need. For others it’s not. For some the medical risks aren’t worth it. For some it’s a financial impossibility. And, believe it or not, some trans* people simply don’t want any kind of surgery. Each person is different.\n\nThere are times where having a penis can be inconvenient, like wearing a bikini to the beach - as I pointed out in my post on swimming & dysphoria. And yeah, the whole testosterone thing is not really up my alley. But the rest of the time, non-issue.\n\nMy dysphoria is mostly social in nature - having to do with where/how/when I can express my gender - beyond that my physical dysphoria comes almost exclusively from secondary sex characteristics, rather than genitals. I worry about losing the hair on my head, I feel discomfort with having the extra body hair that testosterone brings, beard shadow is lame, and I can get bummed about not having boobs. I am planning on having some laser hair removal done on my face, and if I were to transition I would most certainly do hormone replacement therapy, but I have no need for surgical interventions.\n\nIf I were to wake up tomorrow in a body that was fully female with nothing else changed I would be happy and have no regrets or feelings of loss. But as it stands, I embrace the body I have and deal with the things that are dissonant as I need to.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"t-dude-diego","id":97061256071,"post_url":"http://t-dude-diego.tumblr.com/post/97061256071/mornin","slug":"mornin","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 15:37:00 GMT","timestamp":1410277020,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"yNUtco40","tags":["ftm","trans latino","trans mexico","trans","trasngender","transgenero","ftm boy","ftm mexico","transdude","transman","transboy","me"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZInrhm1QPJJk7","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"Mornin~","image_permalink":"http://t-dude-diego.tumblr.com/image/97061256071","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":720,"height":960,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":720,"height":960,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/bca2370d6164a5a226daf8fdaff9b269/tumblr_nbn4q9YlOb1tk2qczo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"micahrae","id":97060702410,"post_url":"http://micahrae.tumblr.com/post/97060702410/so-tonight-at-work-i-came-out-to-one-of-my","slug":"so-tonight-at-work-i-came-out-to-one-of-my","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 15:26:57 GMT","timestamp":1410276417,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"9HhPSYtz","tags":["work","personal","ftm","trans","transgender","transguy","brisbane","coming out"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZyRSLy1QPHCZA","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"So tonight at work I came out to one of my workmates, she was really cool about it and asked some questions.

Whether you’re a first-time visitor or avid fan of Acts of Greatness’ work in empowering Canada’s LGBT youth through educational awards and leadership talks, I’m so glad you’ve found your way here!\n\nThis blog is an essential element to AG’s third pillar of empowerment (besides the education and leadership talks): Storytelling. Along with AG’s photojournalism project Fabulous Alberta and stop-motion animation on history LGBTQueerStory, this blog hopes to showcase diverse experiences of LGBTQ people, both in and beyond Canada.\n\nEach week, our group of bloggers will be giving you opinion, personal narrative, advice, video clips and reviews on topics relevant to LGBTQ youth. There’s too many fantastic ideas and happenings that occur in our worlds everyday to not see daily responses!\n\nIf you would like to contribute to our blog — either regularly or a one-off piece — please email me at editor@actsofgreatness.org. Diversity is one of the strengths of our communities, and I’d love to see as many different people giving their takes on life as possible.\n\nThis blog has been months in the making. When AG’s founder, Yiorgos Boudouris first contacted me to run this blog, I wasn’t sure what to expect, or if I would truly find myself one day writing this post and being able to continually post the brilliant ideas of our bloggers. But here I am, and I appreciate Yiorgos’ insistence that writing and storytelling are powerful means to help LGBTQ youth feel reflected and visible.\n\nI should mention, too, that I appreciate him, as a cisgender ally, making it a point to reach out and find a transgender editor for his blog. I’m thrilled to see what Yiorgos, myself, and our fantastic writers have to offer.\n\nSo, without further ado, thank you for visiting Acts of Greatness to learn What’s On Our Mind Today!\n\nMitch

There’s already a couple of excellent posts,about NN2k14 from two of the organizers, Snowflakeespecial and Mindergenfield, that you can read. \n\nI wasn’t one of the organizers, so I can’t really tell you about the goals of the event or if it should be considered a success. I wasn’t even one of the good people who took notes. What I can tell you is my personal thoughts and feelings from NN2k14.\n\nIt was amazing!\n\nI was surprised at how quickly I became comfortable around everyone there. In many ways New Narratives felt more like a support group than the trans support group I had attended. I actually felt safe to talk and voice my opinions. \n\nIt’s a good thing too because we talked and talked and talked. We talked so much that even after it was over several of us went to a bar and talked for like 2 hours more!\n\nYou’d think with all that talking that we would have come to some sort of consensus, but no. The only consensus was when we already agreed with each other.\n\nMostly New Narratives was a chance to air my grievances with certain aspects of the trans community; share my story with people I felt would actually listen and could understand; and gain some new perspective from listening to other people talk about their life and being a trans woman.\n\nMost importantly to me, it was a chance to do all this in person. Writing online is great. It’s let me talk to so many people across the globe that I’d have never met in my lifetime otherwise. Still real conversations are lessened when they only occur online. There’s something missing when you can’t see someone’s face. When you can’t hear the emotion behind their words. I’m sure there’s some people who would describe it as better and more “rational” that way. I don’t know about you, but rational does not describe the internet I’ve been on. \n\nWe didn’t just talk that day. In fact the thing I remember best was when we did a group walking meditation. It seemed a little silly, but it also felt good. It was supposed to help reconnect with your body, and I think it could it could really help. There were a few times I had to stop myself from laughing though. I couldn’t help it, I just started picturing some random person walking by and seeing a group of people walking in circles with their eyes closed.\n\nOnce everything was said and done, well everything that could be said in a day, I was really glad I’d gone. I loved New Narratives. I made some new friends there. It’s what pushed me to start this blog and actually start talking to some people in real life about the problems within the trans community. If it hadn’t happened, I’d have probably left the trans community completely, slowly gone semi-stealth, and just tried to ignore everything that was going on.\n\nTo the organizers, thank you so much for putting on New Narratives. I can’t wait for the next one; I’ll definitely be there.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"slutwatpizzabutt","id":97050466701,"post_url":"http://slutwatpizzabutt.tumblr.com/post/97050466701/tie-tuesday-i-think-this-is-my-fav-tie","slug":"tie-tuesday-i-think-this-is-my-fav-tie","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 11:47:58 GMT","timestamp":1410263278,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"KW51ZF54","tags":["tie Tuesday","ties","fashion","trans","slutwatpizzabutt"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZmWyRy1QOg9cD","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":7,"caption":"Tie Tuesday.

And as I’ve mentioned before, there’s definitely a sexual aspect to my transition even without sexualizing it, so I don’t mind including the transition in my fetish/sexual-fantasy materials. \n\nIt’s problematic for me, though, because the term comes with a LOT of baggage concerning interests, mostly surrounding men’s dicks. I seriously don’t understand what is so important about this, but it’s so fucking impossible to avoid. I wouldn’t be averse to sex with someone presenting as female who has a penis, sure, but that’s a long way from the obsession that the “sissy” fetish materials present. So I’m nervous about reblogging things that actually include the word “sissy” regardless of how well they apply to me or my desires otherwise. And to be frank, it’s hard to find things that connect to me when they’re covered in phalluses (phalli?). I can’t even stand my favorite things for that long, and I have to put up with this bullshit to get to things that I actually like. It’s really fucking annoying.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"clumsycolours","id":97050054763,"post_url":"http://clumsycolours.tumblr.com/post/97050054763/yay-everyone-at-work-liked-my-hair-its-the","slug":"yay-everyone-at-work-liked-my-hair-its-the","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 11:37:58 GMT","timestamp":1410262678,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"10I6V2nC","tags":["ootd","gpoy","trans","fashion","hairband","clip on bangs"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZeF0ts1QOeb1h","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":16,"caption":"Yay, everyone at work liked my hair (it’s the first time they all saw it like this) :3","photoset_layout":"111","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1920,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":600,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":375,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":150,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1920,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/12c24ca9750e3d137544d4747736deac/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Desire C","ISO":360,"FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1920,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":600,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":375,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":150,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1920,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/832d938b9453d9bceeb1e35bd99820f9/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo2_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Desire C","ISO":360,"FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1920,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":750,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":600,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":375,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":150,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1920,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/ced0d76a7df848b1ae3f71223567cf16/tumblr_nbmtnaBJMl1s7r3obo3_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Desire C","ISO":360,"FocalLength":"3mm"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"cecil-koi","id":97049863416,"post_url":"http://cecil-koi.tumblr.com/post/97049863416/translation-heichous-cute-new-recruit","slug":"translation-heichous-cute-new-recruit","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 11:33:00 GMT","timestamp":1410262380,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"B3i9rYLo","tags":["ereri","kotrans","trans","com","6650545"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZxHyVq1QOdsJu","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":395,"title":"Translation: Heichou's Cute New Recruit","body":"Genre: Fluff for, liek, 2 pages then YANDERE EREN!!

Or redirect me to one you consider informative and well enough explained so that I, someone who has never experienced any of this, can get in touch with the subject for a first time. (+)","answer":"(-) I don’t really worry about other people’s sexualities and genders as long as they’re happy with themselves (and I would want to help the fight you’re all giving from my position as much as possible) but it would be awesome to understand it because if I understand it maybe I can make other people understand and maybe stand from a less (unacknowleding) transphobic position? Idk. Anyways, thank you! :)\n  _______\n  Hi! Not sure how specific you’re wanting but I’ll give a quick run through of the basics and add a few helpful links. It’s always nice when allies want to help.\n\n  First off, a few distinctions should be made.\n\nSex- one’s physical attributes which distinguishes them as male, female, or in the case of intersex people, somewhere in between (there is a wide variety of intersex conditions, but that is another topic for someone more informed on them such as prototran).\n\nGender - how one’s mind perceives what sex they should be. When one’s mind perceives they should be neither male or female they are agender. When one’s mind perceives they should be both simultaneously, they are bigender.\n\nNonbinary- genders other than male or female\n\nGender roles - societal roles based on one’s gender. As society in most cases does accept non binary genders, there are no roles for bigender or agender people. This is just as well as gender roles are basically society/culture wide stereotypes and I think we can all pretty much agree stereotypes suck.\n\nGender non conforming - cis and trans people who don’t conform to gender roles\n\nTrans - people whose gender does not match their sex.\n\nDysphoria - the feeling one gets when their sex and gender do not match. It can vary anywhere from a mild disconnect to a hatred of sex characteristics. It can also manifest as disassociation or depression.\n\nPrimary sex characteristics - sex characteristics pertaining to the reproductive system\n\nSecondary sex characteristics - Characteristics that are basically side effects of sex hormones, suxpch as amount of facial/body hair, size of hands, facial structure, breasts or lack of and so on.\n\n  Sometimes it can be tempting to ask trans people invasive questions out of curiosity but always consider first if you would ask a cis person the same question and if the question could possibly trigger the trans person’s dysphoria. Before delving into their personal life, ask yourself if you really need to and ask them what they’re comfortable talking about if anything.\n\nQuestion that would be helpful to ask a trans person would be things like “what topics should I avoid around you to make sure you’re comfortable?” (A good question to ask any friend really, trans or not) “who are you out to/what gender should I refer to you as with who?” (To avoid outing them and making situations unsafe for them) and similar things.\n\n  An important thing to remember is that gwhile gender dysphoria can lead to hatred of sex charectistics gender dysphoria =/= self hate. Body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria are very different things and I think this link describes the differences well- http://amydentata.com/2012/03/06/the-difference-between-dysphoria-and-negative-body-image/\n\nA simple guide on how to respect trans people: http://m.wikihow.com/Respect-a-Transgender-Person\n\nFor those dating a trans person (it was written specifically for those dating trans men but can easily cover other transgender partners): http://theartoftransliness.com/post/5017698937/how-to-love-and-support-your-ftm-partner-or-your-soffa\n\n  If you’d like to help support trans artists, here’s our pages for that (and if you know anyone we can add, please let us know. We’re also open to adding other minority artists/authors/etc.): http://notyourqueertheoryposterchild.tumblr.com/trans%20artists\n\nhttp://notyourqueertheoryposterchild.tumblr.com/tagged/support\n\nIn comparison to gender, sexuality is a bit more straightforward, especially when keeping it simple and general.\n\nIt’s what gender you’re attracted to.\n  Heterosexual - attracted to the opposite sex/gender\n  Homosexual - attracted to the same sex/gender\n  Bisexual - attracted to two or more genders\n  Asexual - sexually attracted to no one\n\nAsexual people can still be romantically attracted to people, just not sexually attracted. They can have relationships. I’m an asexual trans person in a relationship with a cis hetero man.\n  Bisexual people can have preferences of one gender over another.\n\nAnother person you can ask about these things is genderspatial, he’s pretty knowledgeable, and if you have more specific questions, I’m open to answering more.\n\n***\n\nI (Wulver. ohai.) would like to add some tidbits.\n\nIf someone whose gender is masculine/male is “gender nonconforming,” that does not mean he is transgender. If someone’s gender is feminine/female, but they are physically male, and YET, they are still more socially masculine, that doesn’t mean they are not transgender. Gender and gender ROLES are two separate things.\n\nIf a woman is very socially masculine, but her gender is still feminine/female, she’s not trans just because she is gender nonconforming.\n\nFor a real example - I am a transgender man. My body is female, and I have the dysphoria (disconnect, which is unsettling, but not the same as hate - I’m pretty darn pretty, I just am disconnected and it’s not the place I feel I should be) and yet, I’m still socially feminine. The gender role says that if I’m female, then I have a certain place in society and have a socially stereotypical way to act, think, and talk, etc.\n\nBut because my gender is not female/feminine, that contributes to people not taking me seriously whenever I talk about this kind of thing. I may like to sew and art and cook and do my hair (like the stereotypical woman) but my brain still tells me, through dysphoria (again, not hate, just disconnect) that things aren’t quite right. I’m trans when I’m doing my makeup. I’m trans when I’m squealing like a little girl over something. I’m trans when I’m shopping and cooking and picking out my clothes out of a huge collection.\n\nI’m done. Just wanted to clarify that point because it seems it’s one of the points people have a particularly hard time with.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"insidethechrysalis","id":97042721223,"post_url":"http://insidethechrysalis.tumblr.com/post/97042721223/had-my-first-transgender-support-group-meeting-in","slug":"had-my-first-transgender-support-group-meeting-in","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 07:53:32 GMT","timestamp":1410249212,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"rurA6YMV","tags":["trans","transgender","ftm","support group"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZCAA0s1QOCcd7","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"","body":"Had my first transgender support group meeting in a long time.\n\nThen I get home and dad has a go at me because for some reason he thinks he is entitled to know the birth sex of the people running the group, and doesn’t think that me refusing to tell him is fair.\n\nAll you have to know is who they identify as now.

Oprah’s “Own” channel aired “I am Jazz: a family in transition” back in 2011 which documented 10 year old Jazz’s every day routine, her school life and transition. She now has her own transgender children’s book based on her real-life experience as a young trans girl who has become a spokesperson for transkids everywhere! How cool is that?! Such an awesome picture book to help educate your children on gender differences and acceptance! It’s available at Barnes and Noble and online!

My dad’s blowing his shit at me because I’m not comfortable acting or looking “Female”. \n\nI was always told to let the man handle it, to stay away from the tools and learn how to cook. Reprimanded for not knowing how to clean, and praised when I was able to do theatrical makeup simply because it was makeup. Now that I’m out these traits I was put down for are suddenly more desirable. I’m a techie on the drama club, in the robotics team, in a STEMs school, and now working on cold fusion. Why is it that if I happened to think that I was a female that I would be frowned upon? Why is playing with the neighbors’ kids suddenly okay?\n\nAnd yet, my parents will still correct people when they call me male. Even complete strangers still get a tongue lashing. Just the other day I was at the vet’s office, crouching down to check on one of the animals. I was asked politely to move so someone could get past me, and this person added the formality “young man,” to the end. I was pretty pleased, but my mother felt the need to stop this man and correct him, saying I was biologically female, and then proceeded to point at my chest. \n\nNow, I love my mother to death. She’s a very sweet person and a huge factor as to why I’m still around, but holy fucking shit did that hurt. I was out to her, and she still found the need to call me “Her little girl” and buy dresses and offer to enroll me in Girlscouts. It’s the same thing with my father, only without the passive-aggressiveness and mutual caring. Why do parents feel the need to try and change something that’s already set in stone? You can’t melt the stone down and reforge it. You can weather it, crumble it. Take the dust and put it under pressure so it reforms, but that isn’t the same rock. It has a different composition, and it’s much weaker than it was before. \n\nI just want to know how to talk to them without being ignored.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"yunhoparadise","id":97037455075,"post_url":"http://yunhoparadise.tumblr.com/post/97037455075/trans-night-watchman-jung-yunho-the-tears-acting","slug":"trans-night-watchman-jung-yunho-the-tears-acting","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 05:42:37 GMT","timestamp":1410241357,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"1Br3Aiwh","tags":["tvxq","dbsk","yunho","trans","proud fan here"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZyyEdr1QNuWxZ","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":43,"title":"[trans] \"Night Watchman\" Jung Yunho, The \"tears acting\" which overpowered the controversy over his acting abilities","body":"*note - there are spoilers in this article.\n\n In the 11th episode of “Journal of Night Watchmen”, actor Jung Yunho has, through his “tears acting” filled with genuine emotions, overpowered the controversy over his acting abilities which had previously surrounded himself. \n\n -spoilers omitted-\n\nIn the past, Moo Seok’s sister was inflicted with smallpox and died while being watched over by Moo Seok. Moo Seok said while his tears spilled over, “It would be great if I had been the one who got inflicted instead. There is nothing I can do for you. Even when our mother and father passed away, there was also nothing which I could do for them”.\n\n In this scene, Jung Yunho, who takes on the role of Moo Seok, let loose an explosive outburst of emotions when faced with the death of his sister, and displayed his smooth flowing acting abilities. Through his “tears acting” which captured the attention of viewers and his heart-wrenching gaze, it was sufficient to stimulate the tear glands of the viewers.\n\n In the past, Moo Seok consistently faced everybody and everything around him with a cold and serious attitude, and appeared as a character wearing a veil over him. However, while the past of Moo Seok whereby he had lost his sister in childhood and deeply kept the hurt in his heart was revealed in this day’s episode, the sympathy of the viewers built up when faced with Moo Seok, who had naturally fastly closed the doors to his heart and lived a lonely life to this day.\n\n U-Know Yunho, who had made his debut through TVXQ’s single album “Hug” in 2004, held active activities as a singer and thereafter appeared in MBC’s Wednesday-Thursday drama “Heading to the Ground” in 2009 and last year’s SBS Monday-Tuesday drama “Yawang” etc, building up his filmography as an actor. However, compared to the full-time actors, he was caught up in controversy over his relatively weak emotive expressability and excessive gestures.\n\n Prior to this, at the production press conference for “Journal of Night Watchmen” held in Junifer Hall of the 63 Building in Yeongdeungpo, Yeouido, Seoul, on 29 July, regarding the controversy surrounding him as regards his acting abilities, he had revealed his strong ambitions, “It is my first time in a period drama, and having started out as an idol, I had heard a lot of various criticisms. I have said before that I want to become an actor who gradually grows / improves. I think that I should let my genuity-infused acting pick up through this production”.\n\n Jung Yunho has stamped on the controversy and he is resolutely attempting challenges in the new field of period dramas through “Journal of Night Watchmen”, showing his extraordinary courage. In this regard, he put in his never-ceasing hard work and effort (the Korean phrase literally means “blood-inducing effort”, i.e. putting in tremendous effort), and showed everybody his surprising growth, personally proving that he is progressing as an actor. This is the reason why one cannot help but pay attention to the growing phase of Jung Yunho, reborn as an actor from being an idol.\n\n.\n\nf: newsen | Trans by

Huffington Post","text":"We need a national conversation about transphobia, which dehumanizes, demeans and disadvantages a specific group of people. This is a feminist issue on two levels. First, like racism and homophobia, transphobia grows out of and helps perpetuate the same patriarchal ideology that dictates women’s subordination as second-class citizens. Second, transphobia disproportionately harms women.\n\nTrans women face higher rates of discrimination, violence, sexual assault, and poverty. Around half of all victims of anti-LGBTQIA homicides in 2012 were transgender, and all of them were women of color.\n\nBlack and African-American transgender women have a 50 percent greater homicide rate than their white, Latina, and Native American counterparts and were more than three times as likely to experience police violence more than any other group, according to a 2012 report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs on LGBTQIA and HIV Affected Hate Violence.\n\nThese are all civil rights violations because they are rooted in the denial of a person’s right to be who they are. Equal means equal. That includes equality for all women, not just a certain type of woman. Not just women who look like me!\n\nThe consequences of violating these fundamental rights are not just the alarming rates of homelessness, unemployment, access to health care, economic insecurity, depression and suicide, but also the weakening of the very fabric of our society.\n\nIt diminishes all of us when one type of person or group is targeted, and when they are denied the basic understanding, compassion and protection we all expect and deserve.","source":"From the article “Why Transphobia is a Feminist Issue.”\n\nTerry O’Neill President, National Organization for Women","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"edwarddequeer","id":97036554884,"post_url":"http://edwarddequeer.tumblr.com/post/97036554884/17-18-19","slug":"17-18-19","type":"answer","date":"2014-09-09 05:24:54 GMT","timestamp":1410240294,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"u6KTSFIh","tags":["personal","me","queer","gay","trans","books","death tw","suicide tw maybe","idk not exactly but i feel like i should probably tag it","notanotherprotagonist","ask","message","question"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZETyTv1QNr5A4","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":1,"asking_name":"notanotherprotagonist","asking_url":"http://notanotherprotagonist.tumblr.com/","question":"17, 18, 19?","answer":"17. favorite fairy tale?\n\nI think Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid. I like the strength and the integrity of the little mermaid. She’s a very self-motivated, independent, driven character. And she sacrifices so much—not just her tail, not just all her life, but she sacrifices herself and her happiness and puts the happiness of the one she loves ahead of her own. She’s very hard-working and also a dreamer, someone who believes she can shape her own destiny, as impossible as it may seem. Idk it’s a very depressing fairy tale but I’ve always loved it. Also apparently it was supposed to be a metaphor for HCA’s own gay relationship, and I’ve also seen trans interpretations. So that just adds another queer layer that I like a lot.\n\n18. what would you do if you knew it was the last day on earth?\n\nFind my way back to Paige and spend every last second with her. If the world is ending, I’m not going out any way other than wrapped in her arms.\n\n19. is there anyone you would die for?\n\nObviously you can never really know unless you’re in that situation. But I think yes. Maybe I wouldn’t if I were actually faced with the possibility, but at this moment in time, definitely yes. Paige. Children I nanny/teach. My friends. Tbh I’d probably die for most people, I don’t think my life is worth very much compared to so many others. There are amazing people out there who are going to accomplish so much with their lives and I’m probably not like I’m pretty useless as a human being, so yeah I’d probably sacrifice myself for a lot of people. wow okay that came out a lot more suicidal than I intended, don’t worry about me, I’m not planning on actually putting this into action or anything. I wouldn’t really be able to live with myself if I knew I could have saved someone’s life and didn’t, also, so that’s another factor to consider.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"weareone-blog","id":97036089213,"post_url":"http://weareone-blog.tumblr.com/post/97036089213/trans-140908-sm-choreographer-instagram","slug":"trans-140908-sm-choreographer-instagram","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 05:16:01 GMT","timestamp":1410239761,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"q2icKhrT","tags":["exo","exo-k","chanyeol","140908","trans","Sm","choreographer","instagram update","instagram","update","photo"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZnEEpr1QNpJTz","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":3,"caption":"[TRANS] 140908 SM Choreographer Instagram Update:\n\n\"Must be very busy… Thanks to our EXO for taking care of me ㅋ Lovely Chanyeoli~!

Living in such a small state, our resources felt limited as we continued to look for any sign of help.\n\n About two months ago, we found Amy Herb through our insurance provider, and since then, we’ve never looked back She instantly recognized the fact that Jax had been living as a man for the last five years and referred us to the Mazzoni Center in Philadelphia.\n\n We were able to expedite the process of starting testosterone treatments due to a cancellation at the Mazzoni Center. \n\n Now we’re on the eve of a huge turning point in our lives and I’m feeling conflicted. I am so happy we’ve finally reached the point where this is happening, but it doesn’t mean it’s easy. There’s an uncertainty, the fear of the unknown.\n\n But above all that I realize that I am in love with this person. If he looked at me tomorrow and told me he wanted to be a zebra with purple stripes and plaid hooves, I would still want to be with him forever. We’ve weathered so many storms, there’s no one that knows me better, and no one I would rather spend the rest of my life with.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"jadeisthesanasa","id":97035837193,"post_url":"http://jadeisthesanasa.tumblr.com/post/97035837193/had-to-pull-out-my-glasses-so-i-could-read-a-bitch","slug":"had-to-pull-out-my-glasses-so-i-could-read-a-bitch","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09

article + images) \n\nNote: Left out irrelevant background information regarding the concerts. \n\nLuhan visited a private hospital in Beijing, accompanied by his friend.\n\nEarlier, reporters found EXO chinese member Luhan at a high-class building in Beijing. Luhan was wearing a baseball cap and dressed in all black. He wasn’t dropped off by a van, and was only accompanied by an assistant (t/n: this is his friend, whom Tencent does not recognize) in an SUV. After Luhan and his assistant entered the building, they went to the second floor. The security in the building is strict, but we confirmed that Luhan stopped at the private hospital on the second floor. \n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIn August, on the Xi’An tour, Luhan could not participate in the choreography due to a pulled muscle in his leg, and he could only sit in a chair and sing. \n\nRecently, there has been reports of Luhan not appearing with the members on the flight to their concert, that has resulted in speculation of “leaving group” like member Wu Yifan. But, not long after netizens posted pictures of Luhan flying from Guangzhou to Jakarta, and only then the suspicions were put to rest. \n\nBased on our sources, Luhan has a fear of heights, and is terrified of flying. He usually uses a large amount of sleeping pills to get through the flights. This time he chose a combination of train and plane to reach his schedule, probably for the purpose of shortening his flight. His fear of heights may be getting worse.\n\nWhen the reporters found Luhan on the day of, Luhan seemed to be walking normally, but appeared very tired, his dark circles were obvious. Is this visit to the hospital for his previous leg injury, or has to do with his fear of heights? Or it could be something else? From the time he entered the building to the time he left, Luhan stayed in the hospital for over one hour. When he left, his expression was serious, his brows were furrowed, we are uncertain whether his treatment results were not ideal. On the 20th of this month, EXO will be holding the last stop of their Chinese concert tour in Beijing. Judging by this, Luhan might have to miss the following tours and activities (t/n: this part is meaningless speculation by the reporter, don’t take it seriously).","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"daprojex","id":97028900677,"post_url":"http://daprojex.tumblr.com/post/97028900677/statements","slug":"statements","type":"text","date":"2014-09-09 03:28:00 GMT","timestamp":1410233280,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"WHTTWmsc","tags":["trans","identity","science","spirituality"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZoktMx1QNNuT5","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"STATEMENTS...","body":"…Big UPs to all the proud trans bodies out there!!!

Just nosy enough to stick his nose into an area he knows little about. Which is notable since her refers to it as a new idea.\n\nThe idea of microaggressions was first broached by Harvard Professor Chester M Pierce, then later expanded by MIT Ombudsman Mary Rowe, and now covers a range of characteristics that describe the particulars of interpersonal communication.\n\nA key aspect to microaggressions is that they are not overt acts of hostility, but rather ones that happen without someone realizing it. This is what distinguishes a microaggression from outright discrimination. The user simply doesn’t know they are being a twerp, or, as described by Derald Sue Wing, “Microaggressions are considered to be different from overt, deliberate acts of bigotry, such as the use of racist epithets, because the people perpetrating microaggressions often intend no offence and are unaware they are causing harm.”\n\nMost perpetrators of microaggressions consider themselves to be unprejudiced, with one U.S. study finding that even mental health professionals with extensive antiracist training engaged in microaggressions with African-American clients.\n\nSO they are something that we see quite often, and on tumblr, the use of microaggressions is often met with sharp criticism and cries of racism, sexism, etc, in an unusual demonstration of expecting people to be fully versed in them and hyper vigilant about their own language.\n\nAn intersting thing about microaggressions is that deeply stigmatized people will even use them self referentially, and perpetuate the cycle even when they themselves are hyper aware of these things.\n\nThis is one of the aspects of internalization.\n\nmicroaggressions make them feel invisible, exhausted, frustrated, powerless, emotionally detached, helpless or tense.\n\nThey may also feel a pressure to conform, a loss of their own integrity, or a pressure to “represent” their group.\n\nOver time, the cumulative effect of microaggressions can lead to diminished self-confidence and a poor self-image, and potentially also to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and trauma.\n\nMany researchers have argued that microaggressions are actually more damaging than overt expressions of bigotry precisely because they are small and therefore often ignored or downplayed, leading the victim to feel self-doubting rather than justifiably angry, and isolated rather than supported.\n\nOn the other hand, some people report that microaggressions have made them more resilient.\n\nResearch has shown that when women experience microaggressions, they may become depressed, develop low self-esteem, or experience sexual dysfunction. Some develop eating disorders and body image issues.\n\nResearch has shown that microaggressions can lead people of color to fear, distrust and avoid relationships with white people.\n\nThree commonly used forms of microaggression against trans people assert one of three aspects:\n\nBeing trans isn’t natural (trans women are men, it is a choice, etc)\nConflation with child abuse/Sexual abuse (trans women represent a threat to children/women)\nBeing Trans is sinful\nThe astute may note that the same three core concepts are used against most groups that are marginalized at some time or another (lesbians, gay men, women, Black people, etc).\n\nTumblr happens to house one of the most important collections of microaggressions on the web: http://microaggressions.tumblr.com/\n\nI heartily

them.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"autumn-in-washingtonsquaregarden","id":97027260373,"post_url":"http://autumn-in-washingtonsquaregarden.tumblr.com/post/97027260373/some-people-are-trans-some-people-are-cis-male-or","slug":"some-people-are-trans-some-people-are-cis-male-or","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09

I’m a 29 year old trans guy. I realized I was something other than female a few years ago. And a few months ago I realized that I was FTM. I’ve been running from this thought for a long time. As much as I applaud others who have transitioned in life, I didn’t want it for me. I see how society at large is still unaccepting of trans people. I just want to live a normal boring life. As much as I want to further LGBT rights, I want to do this as an ally, not one of the letters. But I’ve finally accepted that I am in that acronym. I am a “T”. The thing I struggle with now is to let everyone else into the revelation or not. My choices seem to be; live as an unhappy woman accepted by people, or live as a trans man and face a life alone. Neither seems particularly great.\n\nI’ve had many people tell me to just be me. That I’m the only one I have to live with. If people can’t accept me than I don’t need them in my life. And many other such well meaning platitudes. I get the sentiment, but it doesn’t help me. I feel the most fear when it comes to my family. I’m sure you can imagine. I know my family will always love me and accept me. But I’m scared of them not accepting the real me. Seeing who I am on the inside. I worry it will cause a divide. I’m very close to both my parents and my brother. It would devastate me to lose that closeness.\n\nMy other concern is romantic in nature. I’m attracted to men. So, I’m a gay trans man. I’m also a virgin. Not the best combination. I’ve hated my body so much that I can’t imagine letting someone touch it. I can’t even find someone to love me now. How the hell am I going to do it when I have an even smaller subset of the population to work with? Gay men who are willing to date trans men. I know they’re out there. But there are far fewer than there are straight men.\n\nOr, I can just act like a straight woman and hope despair doesn’t take over my life. If there was a pill that would make me cis, I’d take it in an instant.\n\nThe point of this post is not to get sympathy. And I don’t want platitudes or “answers”. I’m just getting it out there. Maybe someone can relate. Or maybe someone can share their experience. I don’t know.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"kissncryspain","id":97023938717,"post_url":"http://kissncryspain.tumblr.com/post/97023938717/140905-dia-instagram-update","slug":"140905-dia-instagram-update","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-09 02:29:31 GMT","timestamp":1410229771,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"lZphJFHd","tags":["Trans","Instagram","140905","Dia","KNC","Kiss&Cry","KissAndCry"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZYDcco1QN4z2T","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"caption":"[140905] DIA Instagram Update\n\n해나언니 화이팅!!!!!! 우린 다 잘될꺼에요!!!!!\n\n[ENG] Haena unnie fighting!!!!!!

Although a great handful of us wish to be others and don’t see our own light that shines off like we should. We tend to waste a huge portion of our lives envying others when we could be working to make ourselves better. Looking up to someone isn’t bad, just don’t copy their ways with intentions to make yourself exactly like them. A lot of the reason we like the things we do are because of people who we admire.\n\nI try to be myself but it’s not an easy task for anyone really. Society, a great deal of the time, knocks us down on our asses just for shits and giggles. The ideal look and standards set are ridiculous. I can’t even be open about the type of people I love without some type of discrimination. We say we are trying to change when really it’s getting worse.\n\nWhy am I not aloud to wear the clothes I want without being questioned?\n\nI do pretty often get stares and nasty comments for wearing the other genders clothing, no one told me it was against the law to look like a boy?\n\nYou would never believe how many times I’ve been asked about my hair. In fact my entire family has openly told me they think I’m suicidal just because of how short my hair is now. My mother won’t let me dye it colors I want to, scared the family will continue to think I want to kill myself. Comments like these are what is going to drive me to death. You have no idea how much better it would be, I could be a boy in the after life and no one would tell me it’s wrong.\n\nOf course it wasn’t always this way. I did in fact fit into society’s standards for a good portion of my life.\n\nOh, was it hell for me. The thing is though, I didn’t completely understand why it even was hell for me. I always blamed my weight and poor eating habits. For a short period of time I would starve myself and even look to self harm to help. It was bad enough where I needed to see a therapist and was prescribed depression pills, which in fact made me feel worse so I took myself off them.\n\nI can not explain to you how good it feels to consider myself as a boy even if no one else does. Everything for the first time has felt right. I can feel myself recovering pretty quickly. I can not control the dysphoria I get because of things I cant change like, periods, boobs, and not having a penis of manly build.\n\nYou can hurt me very easily and a lot. Not just because me as a person gets offended easily but also because referring to me as a girl or any girly part of me is extremely wrong. Why would you need to know my birth name? Because you’re curious? That’s a shit answer really and unless you’re the fucking president or FBI asking I will not tell you my birth name.\n\nWhy does it matter if I identify as a boy and still am attracted to males?

First, it was a marriage and family therapist with no specific knowledge of transgender issues. She was very helpful and allowed me to lay my thoughts and feelings out and help organize and make sense of them. She didn’t do that much work but she sure helped me do some.\n\nNow I have begun to see a therapist that has far more intimate knowledge of the LGBTQ community and is very much involved in the local transgender activities. She has been very helpful. Guiding me and asking thought provoking questions of me but not guiding in the sense of “oh yeah! you need hormones and surgery and stuff”. She allows me to open up and she pokes me enough to help me evaluate me. She helps me find the tools to speak with my wife about these issues and where we should go. I am feeling better with her.\n\nAs of our chat today I will be setting an appointment to see a local doctor. He will be doing my blood panel and we will be discussing hormone treatments. This step may be the one that destroys my marriage. The step that begins the true transformation into womanhood. For me this is huge. Finally moving toward the goal. Being a woman in more physical form. \n\nI’m so very excited but now there is homework to do. I have been assigned, by my therapist, to go home and talk to my wife. Talk to her. Calmly with no yelling and wanton destruction of pedestal fans. To gently re-invite her to look at this journey that I am taking. To allow her to see what she can or will. To also re-invite her to see this therapist or one of her choosing. For me to help give her the tools to examine her love for me and how she may, or may not, accept my being transgender.\n\nIf she can take time to learn, even if she decides to move on she may do so with the knowledge of what’s happening and not just myth and superstition. Maybe she will take my invitation or perhaps she won’t. We have not had a really good productive talk for a long time. This will be a bit hard for me, to speak with her honestly and plainly without having a fit and acting like an idiot.\n\nI am also supposed to sit with her, if she’ll let me, and watch the documentary Trans. I have not yet seen it and I hope she’ll watch it with me. We can only wait and see.\n\nI’m still excited no matter what happens. I’ll keep you posted.\n\nHUGS for all of you.\n\nKatie","accepts_answers":true,"can_reply":false}]

From what I understand, there is one other step. Because they follow an informed consent model, there is an appointment with a hormone advocate and then the medical appointment to get the prescription, but both can be in the same day.\n\nIt’s kind of surreal. I’m not even sure I’m ready, but I figured I’d go do the preliminary stuff and decide afterward how I feel and when I want to do what.\n\nThings to do now:\n\n1. Decide how I want to document this next step in my journey. New tumblr? This tumblr? YouTube? I’ve got some desire to be anonymous, but you know, the internet has a way of making that difficult.\n\n2. Try to get my difficult schedule to be a bit more manageable so the stress of starting T doesn’t cause my life to explode.\n\nOther notes:\n\nI recently had some photos of me, my partner, and family on Facebook. Everyone commented how good we looked. I thought it was a little overboard, but my partner said it was because I looked genuinely happy and that that hasn’t come through in photos for a very long time.\n\nMy partner also said they thought my eyes have changed in the last month or two. Like I’m pregnant or something (PS, there’s no chance of that).\n\nIt does feel that way a bit to me. There’s an extra sparkle in my view of the world—like something extraordinary is about to happen, and I’m the only one who knows about it.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"blanketfork","id":97007295460,"post_url":"http://blanketfork.tumblr.com/post/97007295460/all-trans-people-cute-powerful-important","slug":"all-trans-people-cute-powerful-important","type":"text","date":"2014-09-08

nearby coffee shop, which makes me really anxious but me with long hair, makeup, and a somewhat queer/feminine demeanor is quickly becoming the norm. what i wasn’t expecting was my one really close guy friend (who isn’t queer at all) being off work and wanting to join me.\n\nhe’s seen my nails painted before and knows i read a bunch of queer literature, but we’ve never talked about gender or queerness in terms of identity. i generally try to avoid being too done up when i hang out with him, but i had to make a choice between a) not hanging out with him, b) going home and toning it down or

I hate maybe a total of five people in this world and that is because of things that they have done to me personally or have put me and friends through. Whether or not someone is cis is not grounds enough for me to hate them, and it would be utterly pointless. Just like how it would be pointless for someone that is cis to hate me because I am trans*. See? There’s no logic in it. I basically love everyone, give or take those five people, and I want nothing more than for everyone to feel that they matter. \n\nSo I don’t hate cis people, never have and never

Or, more accurately, like glasses worn from childhood, it’s like a lens through which we’ve always seen and can’t remember how the world looked before. And the lens is strictly bifocal. It strangely shows us only black and white in a Technicolor world.”\n\nDo you think Siebler would agree with this idea? What issues of gender politics are a play in the (attempted) cultural and social undestanding of transgender identity and media respresentation? Does an individual’s ability to consume and create content (and identity) via a digital medium help to mitgate the issues of gender politics? What examples of a mediated trans identity do we have? \n\nMy response:\n\nI wrote two posts on my personal blog while reading this piece, I had a very strong reaction to it, and was, honestly, offended that the first time I find transgender people discussed in an academic textbook it starts off talking about and framing the conversation around a white, cisgender, heterosexual man.\n\n—-\n\n\"Transgender characters such as Laverne Cox on ‘I Want to Work for Diddy’, Carmelita on ‘Dirty Sexy Money’, and Isis King on ‘America’s Top Model’ all fit the ‘chick with a dick, gay barbie’ stereotype of MTF transqueers.\" (136)\n\nTwo of the three people that Siebler is writing about here are transwomen. One I know for a fact is self-identified as a transwoman. Siebler, who just earlier was praising Tim Curry for his embracing of femininity (“If we did not want to be just like Curry *and* his character, we wanted to be his friend.”) Boldly attacks tranwomen for theirs, “She (Laverne Cox) is articulate, smart, and politically astute. But these dynamics of her politics and intellect never make it to the ‘I Want to Work for Diddy’ show where she plays a stereotypical “gay Barbie” with big hair, Valley Girl language and glamorous fashion.”\n\n—-\n\nSiebler does not write of trans people in a language that suggests that they are trans themselves. And yet, whether trans or not, they seem hyper-critical of the fact that transpeople go to great lengths to “pass” without giving any space to discussing the experiences that trans people have as living trans and navigating the world as trans that causes them to feel a need to move towards spaces of “passing” one way or the other.\n\nWith those posted, I can more directly address the prompt now.\n\nI very much believe that Siebler would agree with Wilchins. Siebler espouses how much they view Dr. Frank-N-Furter as the technicolor to an otherwise black and white world.\n\nWhat issues are at play? We have issues of representation - both quantifiably, but also qualitatively. What qualitatively qualifies as a transgender person in the media. Siebler gives the reader the impression that Timothy Curry and Ru Paul in drag are at the forefront of what it means to be transgender, while transwomen such as Laverne Cox and Candis Cayne are simply reinforcing gender stereotypes and acting out for the camera (see my quote from Siebler above). So there we have what qualifies as a stereotype and what qualifies as authentic gender expression at play. We seem to also have at play this cissexism and man-identified-centrism that plays out (thus why we see Curry raised up and praised, while Cox is vilified). This all seems to play into, or at least feed off/fuel the oppositional idea, that these women (Cox, Cayne) are not real women, and so when they enter women’s spaces, they are thusly violating women and their (women’s) spaces. This can be seen exemplified best in the fascination with genitalia, which I’ve already talked about extensively, and in the bathroom panic craze that is fuel by the media.\n\nI fully believe, and have it exemplified in my own life, that a person’s ability to consume and create content via a digital medium can help to mitigate the issues of gender politics. The popular blogging site Tumblr is where I finally found the language and community to be comfortable and out, at least to myself, as transgender, as a transwoman.\n\nBy ‘examples of a mediated trans identity’, do we mean, like in my case, that I mediated my gender identity (in part) online?

I'm just going to start by saying that as a bisexual it's quite annoying when you give me the tag \"homophobia\" - I'm not saying that bisexuals can't be homophobic, or that gay people can't be homophobic, but it's just the fact that I don't think my ask was in any way homophobic or any type of phobic against any LGBTQ person. (1/2)","answer":"(Label person - 2/3) Also, I read that blog, even though seeing a website with the word “theist” in the URL did somewhat deter me at first I still read it; it wasn’t really focused at people like me who think, in a simple sense, we “have enough labels”, it was primarily directed towards people who disagree with labeling on the whole, which I do not. If you’re curious by the way, I’m also someone who disagrees with the hijacking of the word “gender” - there are only two genders in my opinion.\n\n(Labeling person again lol, I changed my mind from X/2 to X/3, so 3/3) Also, in terms of biology and representation, I understand that someone who was a woman and now is a man is now a man, I’m not saying they aren’t, I’m just saying beyond a man and a woman there’s nothing, even asexuals for example, they’re still either men or women, having sex or lack there of doesn’t define your gender etc.\n\nI needed to add a ‘transphobic’ to it too, which I have just done (since you were primarily attacking trans people, seems like). It doesn’t matter if you think non-binary genders exist or not, they do & will exist with or without your input. Your opinion is irrelevant to their existence.\n\nAlso, you don’t know what asexuality is. Asexuality is not a gender, it’s a sexuality (or a lack of, if you prefer). You might want to google it.\n\nWhilst we’re at it, you don’t really know what gender is, either. In fact it might be a good idea if you refrained from having an opinion on things that you clearly know nothing about.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"pixel-powered-painter","id":96993389624,"post_url":"http://pixel-powered-painter.tumblr.com/post/96993389624/losing-weight-and-starting-to-look-more-feminine","slug":"losing-weight-and-starting-to-look-more-feminine","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 20:07:54 GMT","timestamp":1410206874,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"XwlQJN86","tags":["self","trans","my face"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZQFTsw1QLGQmu","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"caption":"Losing weight and starting to look more feminine too.

If gender is the set of genitals you're the most comfortable with, then a/bigender should mean that you want neither/both of them, shouldn't it? But AFAIK, no one gets their genitals removed without a substitute, or the \"missing\" set together with the one they already have. If it's more like a Idon'tgiveafuck-gender, then why make a big deal out of it by yelling at people who got your pronouns wrong? I just don't understand it.","answer":"To the best of my knowledge:\n\nAgender- Needing the sex characteristics of neither sex in order to lessen dysphoria. This is a sucky situation to be in, because without massive nullification surgery (which is usually illegal), it’s nearly-impossible. Of course other dysphoria-reducing methods can be employed, hormones, pronoun changes, surgeries to remove obvious secondary sex characteristics, etc. \n\nBigender part one- Someone who fluctuates between two genders. Some believe this to be a case of mistaken normal symptoms as something else. Since dysphoria fluctuates in every trans person, binary or no, it might be possible bigender people are binary but have very strong fluctuations. My thought is that it is most likely that, but it could also (maybe) be a rapid-cycle version of part two.\n\nBigender part two- There is a known phenomena where people will have sex dysphoria very strongly for years, and then shift back to having none (being non-dysphoric about their birth sex) for years. (Which could become a case of having dysphoria towards the sex they transitioned to.) Then they shift back after years, etc. It’s insanely, extremely rare and controversial (maybe they were never dysphoric and transitioned and acquired actual dysphoria.)\n\nPeople who don’t give a fuck about their gender- This is a result of cis privilege. Not having think about your gender constantly is a privilege we are in possession of. Trans people have to be aware of their gender constantly- sometimes for safety, sometimes because of dysphoria, sometimes because of the millions of things it takes to transition. Like how white people don’t have to think about race, cis people don’t have to think about gender. So it’s upsetting (and rude!) to call someone a wrong pronoun, even if they don’t give too many fucks. So stick to whatever you’re told to use (or, if you use one and no one corrects you, stick to that.)","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"edman93-t-diary","id":96988457044,"post_url":"http://edman93-t-diary.tumblr.com/post/96988457044/sometimes-i-look-back-at-old-photos-in-disbelief","slug":"sometimes-i-look-back-at-old-photos-in-disbelief","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 19:01:04 GMT","timestamp":1410202864,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"1wbAtnXB","tags":["ftm","trans","transition","testosterone","transman"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZVY9av1QKzcXK","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":108,"source_url":"http://edman93-t-diary.tumblr.com","source_title":"edman93-t-diary","caption":"Sometimes I look back at old photos in disbelief.

I hate like 99% of the people I know, they don’t even try.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"con-va-les-cence","id":96987432750,"post_url":"http://con-va-les-cence.tumblr.com/post/96987432750/are-my-shirts-shrinking-or-am-i-actually","slug":"are-my-shirts-shrinking-or-am-i-actually","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 18:45:00 GMT","timestamp":1410201900,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"qV3eWeRp","tags":["selfie","ftm selfie","trans","transmascuine","tpoc","transpoc","qpoc","queer","poc"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZIyxWw1QKviSk","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"caption":"\"Are my shirts shrinking or am I actually gaining?\": A Series.","image_permalink":"http://con-va-les-cence.tumblr.com/image/96987432750","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1707,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1707,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/2b37e75fdd75ce3f7c901ffb382f4088/tumblr_nblirthVNB1r6icq6o1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" iPhone 5","ISO":160,"Aperture":"f/2.4","Exposure":"1/20th","FocalLength":"4mm"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"dandy1ion","id":96986707958,"post_url":"http://dandy1ion.tumblr.com/post/96986707958/finally-got-the-results-of-my-first-blood-work","slug":"finally-got-the-results-of-my-first-blood-work","type":"text","date":"2014-09-08 18:34:31 GMT","timestamp":1410201271,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"s25bvAxK","tags":["ftm","trans","ok","so not actually over 9000","but very high for men","the estrogen part is word for word though",":3","that healthy part is probably the most shocking",":D :D :D :D :D"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZCMHHw1QKsxVs","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"title":"","body":"Finally got the results of my first blood work after being on T!\n\nMy T levels: over 9,000!!!\n\nMy estrogen: VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT\n\nalso I’m healthy!","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"sallymolay","id":96986481411,"post_url":"http://sallymolay.tumblr.com/post/96986481411/new-web-series-true-trans-with-laura-jane-grace","slug":"new-web-series-true-trans-with-laura-jane-grace","type":"link","date":"2014-09-08 18:30:48 GMT","timestamp":1410201048,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"VVNW6VxQ","tags":["trans","transgender","transsexual","lgbt","lgbtqa","genderqueer","laura jane grace","true trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZkvNKn1QKs4C3","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":40,"title":"New Web Series 'True Trans With Laura Jane Grace'","url":"http://time.com/3256182/laura-jane-grace-aol-true-trans/","link_image":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_nbfde9mdWX1tddzm2_og.jpg","description":"Laura Jane Grace is the most visible transgender woman in music today […]. In her upcoming AOL Originals series, True Trans With Laura Jane Grace, the rocker travels around the country and meets with a number of transgender men and women to talk about their hardships, coming out, transitioning and just how messy the idea of gender can be.\n\n“The opportunity I had while shooting this show was nothing short of tremendous,” Grace says of the show, whose trailer premieres exclusively on TIME today. “Getting the chance to listen to other people tell their stories of how life shaped their identities and views on gender couldn’t help but further inform my own understanding of just how complicated and also how simple all of it really is.”\n\nRead the whole story!\n\nPhoto by Leslie Lyons for

Then you are a fucking idiot. It is in fact that simple. To do that is the height of ignorance and stupidity. If you were to judge an individual on their own behavior (being rude or cruel, kind or caring, accepting and progressive, bigoted or racist) then you are saying “Hey person, I don’t/do like what you’re doing”. You cannot EVER apply what SOME people in a group do to the WHOLE GROUP. You cannot hate an entire race because a person of that race treated you badly. You cannot hate an enter gender because someone of that gender treated you badly. You cannot hate an entire religion, faith or belief because someone treated you badly. \n\nAs a trans person, I know how it feels to not quite fit in with the “norm” (whatever the fuck that even is), but I have never decided that an entire group is against me. Because I’m not fucking stupid. I take the problems that are faced by trans people as they come. If (hypothetically speaking and because this is what Tumblr seems to get its panties in a knot about the most) a white/cis/male gave me shit, I would be hating on that person, not the entirety of white/cis/males. If you hate on an entire group because of your treatment at the hands of one asshole belonging to that group, guess what, you are the fucking problem, not the group. There are, however, some problems faced by the trans community that are there because of social (again, what even) “norms” like public restrooms and gender specific areas etc. But you still cannot label everyone you meet that is cis as ‘scum’ because of this.\n\nHating a whole group because of your shitty treatment at the hands of a few is going to have the exact opposite effect if you want their support or acceptance. Rather than waging war on groups of people and generalizing the shit out of them, maybe you should focus on waging war on the assholes who give the groups a bad name.\n\nI cannot believe how many people on this site are so pathetic they can’t want to be offended and try to start shit. What boring, sad and unfulfilled lives you lead. To hate a group or to generalized a group so completely is exactly what you should be fighting against, not doing yourselves. In your fight against oppression, you have become the oppressors.\n\nAnd as for the privilege argument, to hate someone based on what they were born with is just flat out discrimination. Who the fuck do you think you are to complain that someone is oppressing you just by being born a certain race or gender/sex. You shout for equality, but you don’t even know the meaning of the word. You don’t want to be equal to the ‘privileged scum’ you want to be the privileged scum. You want to reign supreme above the people you hate. You are a fucking idiot. \n\nAnd I would also like to point out that every minute of everyday you are using something that was created by a person from a group you hate. For example all the cis hate on Tumblr, people saying that cis people should all die, BY POSTING ON A SITE CREATED BY A CIS PERSON. \n\nBasically when you discover what equality really means and if you decide that that is what you actually want, then we can talk. An asshole is an asshole regardless or race, sex, gender or religion. If you are not an asshole we should get along swimmingly.\n\n/rant.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"becomingjoselyn","id":96982704099,"post_url":"http://becomingjoselyn.tumblr.com/post/96982704099/day-46-comparison-the-first-two-pics-are-from","slug":"day-46-comparison-the-first-two-pics-are-from","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08

So for example you might be attracted to non-binary people and women, and you would be bisexual. Pansexual, in comparison, means that you’re attracted to all genders. So there is a difference, albeit a fairly subtle one, and there’s a fair bit of crossover.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of people do use bisexual in a cissexist way (i.e. just male/female), often cutting out non-binary people (or even not recognising binary trans people), but using it that way is transphobic & cissexist.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"rachel-rebellion","id":96981749210,"post_url":"http://rachel-rebellion.tumblr.com/post/96981749210/so-in-the-class-that-i-ta-for-there-is-a-girl-who","slug":"so-in-the-class-that-i-ta-for-there-is-a-girl-who","type":"text","date":"2014-09-08 17:13:14 GMT","timestamp":1410196394,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"z2ODQMOK","tags":["trans","bullying","students","school","thank you","we all have something that can be made fun of"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZgR2tt1QKa0tQ","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":2,"title":"","body":"So in the class that I TA for there is a girl who is trans.

I wasn’t like other guys who found out what it is to be trans and had their identity click on like a light. I’ve known about the trans community for a while now. I’ve supported friends as they questioned their own identities and came out. I’ve even joined friends at trans support group meetings. All the while I avoided my own gender issues. It’s part of my personality; I avoid negative emotions like the plague (if you know anything about personality typing, I’m an Enneagram 7w6).\n\nImagine my surprise when I’m watching a transition video with Husband and feel a sharp pang of jealousy. It caught me off guard, and to be honest it scared me. I know it’s not an easy road, and I don’t take the decision to explore it lightly.\n\nLike I said, I don’t fall into the group of people who go “Oh, trans is a thing? Now I know what I am!” but that’s not to say I ever really accepted my identity as female. In fact I’ve always whole-heartedly, almost violently rejected it. Even at a young age I was offended if people suggested I was a girl. No, I don’t want princess face paint, I want to be a knight. Halloween was a yearly battle with my mom, who wanted my costumes to be somewhat recognizable as female. I hated dresses and skirts and bows, was furious when people bought me Barbies, hated my name for being too overtly feminine, and chopped all my hair off the moment I was allowed. Really the only thing I didn’t outright reject were pronouns.\n\nI went so far as to start joking about being a “man’s man.” I always felt like I needed to prove myself. Kind of like the quintessential “becoming a man” trial, only it was every opportunity to be masculine of every day. I never felt like I was taken seriously.\n\nFor a long time, though, I simply considered myself a tomboy. A really boyish tomboy. When I did scratch the surface of gender identity, I was under this misconception that because I didn’t have very strong dysphoria (eh, boobs, eh, vagina), that I wasn’t trans enough to really be trans. That maybe it wasn’t being female that I rejected, just the social idea of being feminine. After all, I’ve read stories of kids from very young ages knowing they were trans. If they just knew shouldn’t I just know?\n\nBut that’s not how it works for everyone. Maybe that’s not how it works for me.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"fy-exo","id":96972615817,"post_url":"http://fy-exo.com/post/96972615817/140908-zyxzjs","slug":"140908-zyxzjs","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 14:28:00 GMT","timestamp":1410186480,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"4qvoTDQm","tags":["exo","lay","p: instagram","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Zok8jx1QK1B29","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":554,"caption":"140908 zyxzjs: 추석잘보내세요 여러분 (여기 한장 밖에 못보내요 ㅠㅠ)\nEveryone, spend Chuseok happily (I can only post one picture here ㅠㅠ)","image_permalink":"http://fy-exo.com/image/96972615817","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":500,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":400,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":250,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":100,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":640,"height":640,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/8e04ae1ac7c248b964886ee75a822c8a/tumblr_nbl6w8zu1V1qhmxnlo1_1280.jpg"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"trippy-tyger","id":96972552798,"post_url":"http://trippy-tyger.tumblr.com/post/96972552798/half-a-year-on-testosterone-say-whaattt","slug":"half-a-year-on-testosterone-say-whaattt","type":"video","date":"2014-09-08 14:27:42 GMT","timestamp":1410186462,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"aOSbUtiY","tags":["ftm 6 months on t","ftm","Transman","trans","transgender","transguy","FTM transition","Testosterone","testosterone update","6 months","6 months on testosterone","6 months testosterone update"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZOPBUt1QK0xfU","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":8,"caption":"Half a year on testosterone, say whaattt.","permalink_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPxJ5Dcko9Y","html5_capable":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPxJ5Dcko9Y/hqdefault.jpg","thumbnail_width":480,"thumbnail_height":360,"player":[{"width":250,"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"250\" height=\"140\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPxJ5Dcko9Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"width":400,"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPxJ5Dcko9Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"width":500,"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPxJ5Dcko9Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}],"video_type":"youtube","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"snappy94","id":96972484556,"post_url":"http://snappy94.tumblr.com/post/96972484556/one-more-week-until-2nd-year-well-freshers-gonna","slug":"one-more-week-until-2nd-year-well-freshers-gonna","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 14:26:22 GMT","timestamp":1410186382,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"EZ7PNSII","tags":["trans","hrt","mtf"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z_YKTs1QK0g-C","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":20,"caption":"One more week until 2nd year, well freshers.

Then we notice that our spirits still reside within us, and that that essence is pure, and we celebrate the return of our souls into our bodies after that absent time during our slumbers.\n\nEach morning we look out upon the world and offer up gratitude because a day that begins with gratitude is a better day. A day that we transform with words of thanks in turn transforms us into grateful people.\n\nI am so grateful to be among all of you today. \n\nSo I offer you another blessing from the opening prayers of a Jewish morning service:\n\nבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, שֶׁעָשַׂנִי בְּצֶלֶם אֱלֹהִים\n\nPraised are You, the Infinite source of a miraculous creation, who made me, and all of us, in the divine image.\n\nEach and every one of us here today reflects another gorgeous facet of the image of the divine. To be in the image of the infinite is to be infinitely varied. \n\nLet us begin our day in praise of the purity of our inner spirits, and in awe of the beautiful variety of our outward appearances.\n\nLet our time together be filled with soulful beauty, and pure diversity, and let us say: Amein.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"adigitalmagician","id":96969945312,"post_url":"http://adigitalmagician.tumblr.com/post/96969945312/i-dont-often-like-photos-of-myself-but-im","slug":"i-dont-often-like-photos-of-myself-but-im","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 13:34:41 GMT","timestamp":1410183281,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"TqV8hjL2","tags":["Magician's Handiwork","selfie","makeup","trans","dmab"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z2qnkt1QJs-3W","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":10,"caption":"I don’t often like photos of myself, but I’m getting pretty good with my eyeliner.","image_permalink":"http://adigitalmagician.tumblr.com/image/96969945312","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":667,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":533,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":333,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":133,"url":"http://33.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":960,"height":1280,"url":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cde01fe6a0a1d3f1ad746d8fe3664270/tumblr_nbl4dtUR8u1rlbcd2o1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" iPhone 5c","ISO":400,"Aperture":"f/2.4","Exposure":"1/20th","FocalLength":"2mm"}}],"can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"just-some-lesbian-kat","id":96968778967,"post_url":"http://just-some-lesbian-kat.tumblr.com/post/96968778967/why-am-i-always-down","slug":"why-am-i-always-down","type":"text","date":"2014-09-08 13:09:50 GMT","timestamp":1410181790,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"wkeR3jp0","tags":["transgender","trans","male","feels","ftm","help"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZUX8Zx1QJoYJN","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Why am I always down?","body":"I really think I am meant to be a guy!","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"transitional-monster","id":96967906871,"post_url":"http://transitional-monster.tumblr.com/post/96967906871/introduction-and-and-explination","slug":"introduction-and-and-explination","type":"text","date":"2014-09-08 12:50:00 GMT","timestamp":1410180600,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"mpMR8NYr","tags":["journal","transition","ftm","trans"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZOuwXm1QJlDOt","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":0,"title":"Introduction and and Explination","body":"Hello one and all.

He was definitely living, and he was definitely a man. There were sharp angles casting shadows around his face that spoke to masculinity, and when you laid a hand over his chest there was a pulsing, twisting heartbeat at odds with a staccato drawing of breath. Sometimes the shadows joined in. Definitely living. Definitely a man.\n\n *\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n Anna thought she had two neighbours for the longest time. Brother and sister, perhaps even twins. Perhaps even identical twins, she thought, silently assuring herself she was an open-minded young woman who certainly wouldn’t ever bring such a thing up.\n\n When she discovered her misunderstanding, she laughed and thought, open-minded, open minded.\n\n \"The whole having two names thing kind of throws people,\" her neighbour says, Jennifer today. Her hair is long and her eyeliner spectacular. Anna would probably at least punch someone for her cheekbones. \"It always ends up like some shitty sitcom.\"\n\n \"It was the hair that threw me,\" Anna says, still laughing. \"I guess it must be a wig?\"\n\n \"Oh, no,\" says Jennifer, looking surprised, \"Hang on. Let me show you.\"\n\n Her face liquifies and rearranges itself, slipping out of reality like running water down a plughole, and Anna thinks blankly- I thought gender fluid was a metaphor.\n\n *\n\n It’s true she has a girl inside her waiting to get out.

Since March, they have toured around four continents in their Pacific Tour, meeting their fans around the world. Since their debut in 2012, although it has only been 2 years, with this momentum, it is as if B.A.P does not know how to stop.\n\nIn their last interview, they said they “wanted to create a meaningful concert which has something that remains even when it is over” (HIMCHAN). After 3 months of the Pacific Tour, what has remained with them?\n\nYOUNGJAE: Really, I think the time spent with meeting the fans was the most precious time. There was an urge to start a tour again as soon as possible, to use our experiences this time as a basis to build upon an even better tour next time.\nYONGGUK: In this tour, we have visited many countries and places that we haven’t been to before, like Europe, Australia, Chicago and LA in the States - every one of them have left a deep impression!\nZELO: The impressions of fans in different countries are very different. In the States, although we were performing a distance away from the town centre, we were very happy that there were still lots of people who came to cheer for us.\n\nThe last stop of the tour was Japan. The 8500 fans at the final stop in Chiba Messe were very excited.\n\nJONGUP: The cheering from fans has got louder than before, and we could feel that we are having fun together. We were very surprised that the fans stood up and waited before the concert started, and were very touched.\nYOUNGJAE: In the last concert, I went down to the audience seats. Then one fan came and caught me… (laughs). Although I was happy and laughed at the spot, as there were many people, I was worried about [the fan(s)] being injured. I am glad it did not turn into an accident. It left a big impression.\nHIMCHAN: It is lonely once the tour has ended, and there are fans who feel sad as well. It is overwhelming for me too.\nZELO: I noticed that the age range of fans who enjoy our concerts has widened from previous concerts in Japan. I am surprised that there are also elderlies and families who come to our concerts.\n\nAlthough B.A.P says that it’s their first time going to lots of places on this tour, when asked about how they spend their time on days other than the concert, it seems that all of them replied with “shopping!”.\n\nDAEHYUN: When speaking of an activity that we all enjoy together, it has to be shopping (laughs). After sight-seeing and taking photos, if there is time left, it’s mainly shopping.\nYONGGUK: We would all go to shops that we wanted to visit, right? Then we would visit landmarks, and there would also be times when we just drink coffee at a cafe and observe people.\nJONGUP: Also, we would play basketball at the place. In America, we played basketball in a nearby court with the locals. It was a lot of fun (laughs).\n\nHaving grown after a long overseas tour, B.A.P is releasing “EXCUSE ME” in Japan on 3 September. Having been compiled into their 3rd Korean album “BADMAN”, it is the Japanese version of a song that has gathered a lot of popularity.\n\nHIMCHAN: Although it’s originally a Korean song and is now being made into Japanese, I think it’s been made into a song that is easy for our Japanese fans to sing along together. It’s a cheerful song, so let’s enjoy it together!\nYONGGUK: It is a strong hip-hop song that has our colour. It has received a lot of positive response during our tour, so now it has become the title song of our Japanese album. The coupling song “COFFEE SHOP” is a bit different from our usual strong style, being a soft jazz. “ZERO” is hip-hop style, but its atmosphere is again different from “EXCUSE ME”, being more of a “prankster” kind of song.\nDAEHYUN: The song that we would like [you] to listen to in the summer onwards, really, is probably “EXCUSE ME”. It is the most exciting song, so I recommend it for summer!\n\nIt has been 10 months since your debut in Japan last autumn. To B.A.P what do these 10 months mean?\n\nDAEHYUN: I think these 10 months has been a time for us to experience what we haven’t experienced before. Being able to finally meet lots of fans, it was precious and meaningful time.\nZELO: I also feel that we have grown bit by bit through tours and concerts. We have visited lots of countries that we haven’t been to before, and through interacting with fans of different nationalities we have learnt a lot about cultures as well. It was a time when we learned about a lot of different things.\n\nAlthough you’ve been to Japan lots of times, after these 10 months, are there any moments when you have realised some “surprising Japanese culture”?\n\nHIMCHAN: When we were having an event in Odaiba, there was a huge Gundam! It was very surprising (laughs). I was so surprised, this is what that has left the greatest impression on me (laughs).\nYONGGUK: Croissant taiyaki! (T/N: Taiyaki: a fish-shaped sweet bun with red bean paste filling) It’s covered with sugar and packed with fillings inside. It was really delicious!\nHIMCHAN: Regarding food, the strangest one are probably Monjyayaki (T/N: a sort of savoury pancake) and Gyutan (T/N: ox tongue) (laughs).\nJONGUP: Ah, gyutan… When I knew what it really is, there was a weird feelings… The tongue of a cow…\nALL: (laughs)\nZELO: During the hand-shaking events, I am surprised by the number of fans who cosplayed as me. “NO MERCY” era and “Warrior” era when I first debuted were all cosplayed so well, I felt slightly weird as if seeing myself (laughs).\nHIMCHAN: Because Zelo always has a very characteristic style like hair style and outfit, it is always very easy to spot fans who are cosplaying as him.\n\nIt is B.A.P’s Japan debut first anniversary this October. The anniversary is very soon, and events are being held in September just before. Let’s hear from the members what they would like to try during their first anniversary.\n\nYOUNGJAE: As it’s our first anniversary, maybe we can hold a special event. Something like a discussion meeting where fans consult us about their troubles would be great. We would consult them about our troubles too. Then, should we go shopping together? In practice, that would be difficult (laughs).\nHIMCHAN: On our first anniversary, I would like to go to Japan with our members not for work but on private. It will be a secret from the staff (laughs). Going to shopping, sight-seeing and eating delicious food on our own!\nYONGGUK: For me, on a special day like the first anniversary, I would of course like to spend it with fans.\nYOUNGJAE: Then we can celebrate ourselves. It would be great if we can even make couple rings (laughs). Pajama party sounds good too (laughs).\n\nB.A.P runs their daily schedule as one of the groups who strive to reach the top of K-POP. While your private time lessens, if you walk on the streets fans would be drawn and stir things up. If they had a day when they wouldn’t catch anyone’s eye, what would they do?\n\nDAEHYUN: I would like to go to the sea and the beach. Near my home there is a beach which I used to go to a lot, but recently I haven’t got any time so I don’t really visit there anymore…\nYONGGUK: I would like to go back to my home, to meet my family after long, and spend a day together in leisure.\n\nLet B.A.P deliver us a final message for us.\nDAEHYUN: To our fans in Japan! “EXCUSE ME” is produced in Japanese so everyone can enjoy, so please look forward to it. Also, we would like to show our cool images!\nZELO: I want to meet you all soon.

He’s one of my best friends in the whole world, and he’s having a lot of trouble right now. Konner is transgender, and while he has been out to his family for several years now, things have not gotten any better for him at home. Konner is about to start testosterone in the coming weeks, and his father has already told him he will stop supporting him financially as soon as he does. This means that Konner will have to pay for everything, including college, on his own. If he is unable to stay at school, Konner will either have to find a way to afford his own apartment, or live with his parents in an extremely unhealthy and mentally abusive environment. Konner is at the point where he needs to start testosterone for his own health and well-being, no matter what his parents decide to do in response. This is where you guys come in.\n\nPlease, please, if you can afford it, consider donating to Konner at this link right here. It would help him out so much and it would mean the world to him. Even if you can’t donate, taking the time to share this post could really help him out, so if you could help spread this around, I know he would appreciate it a ton.

Me senti aliviado cuando salió.\n\nHay canciones de diferentes generos, los fans problamente se sientan muy renovados. ¿Cual es el concepto? \n\nTengo una imagen en mi mente de levantarme en una nueva mañana. Este album es muy diferente al anterior. Tanto para SOLAR y HOT, hice cosas en las cuales ya era bueno y traté de profundizar esas habilidades. Pero al correr del tiempo, pensé que habia más posibilidades para mi música. Creo que las personas ahora podran sentir las nuevas posibilidades y emociones.\n\n¿Cuál es tu canción favorita?\n\nLOVE YOU TO DEATH. Es una canción memorable porque trabajé en ella con un productor que amo, Happy Pérez. Fui muy feliz de trabajar con el en EEUU y realmente amo el sonido de esta canción.\n\n¿Cómo trabajaste con G-Dragon?\n\nEl es mi amigo más cercano, asi que no tuvimos que gastar mucho tiempo trabajando. Cuando ambos sentimos “esto es bueno” solo continuamos adelante. Nos conocemos uno al otro desde una edad muy temprana y somos muy buenos amigos que han experiementado tantas cosas juntos. Somos capaces de inspirarnos uno al otro porque lo que poseemos es diferente.\n\n¿Tu primer tour en solitario en japón empieza este agosto?\n\nQuise lanzar un album porque queria ir de gira. Realmente quise expresar mi mundo asi que planeé los videos y la conformación del escenario desde 1 a 10. Quiero seguir haciendo presentaciones donde pueda estar cerca y crear buenas memorias con todos y cada uno de mis fans.\n\n¿Cómo se sintieron los otros miembros sobre tu album?\n\nEllos estan celosos (risas) Cada uno de ellos me dieron un mensaje cuando escucharon mi album. Me dieron su apoyo porque saben cuanto tiempo y esfuerzo puse en el.\n\n¿Cuál es tu rutina diaria?\n\nMe levanto más o menor a la hora del almuerzo, las 12, y como lo que sea que hay en mi casa. Pero usualmente no tengo comida asi que solo voy a la YG y como en su cafetería. Luego entreno en el gimnasio por 1 hora y media ~ 2 . Si no hay nada mas que hacer, voy a casa y veo una pelicula o leo. Vuelvo a la oficina de nuevo y tengo una larga charla con GD y los productores porque somos buenos amigos. Si hay buenas palabras o conceptos de la conversación comienzo a trabajar en las canciones. Luego ceno y voy a casa alrededor de la 1am.\n\n¿Que parte de tu cuerpo te gusta?\n\nMi espalda. Estuve entrenando por mucho tiempo asi que tengo musculos gruesos.\n\n¿Qué quieres hacer este otoño?\n\nComer persimmon. Amo las frutas de estación. Tambien quiero ir a ver las hojas pintadas de otoño.\n\n¿Qué parte de tu cuarto te gusta?\n\nVivo en un edificio de departamentos en la ciudad y se siente tan frio asi que la verdad quiero mudarme a un lugar mas cálido. Hay un arból al lado del departamento asi que ese es mi lugar favorito para ir a renovarme.\n\n¿Qué haces por salud? \n\nComo frutas y bebo vinagre de persimmon antes de dormir. El sabor es tan malo, pero es bueno para el cuerpo asi que trato de beberlo.\n\n¿Cuál es tu estilo favorito en una chica? (Se refiere a su forma de vestir)\n\nAmo cuando viste el estilo que más le convenga a ella. Faldas o estilo urbano, lo que sea que vaya con la persona!\n\n¿Con cual de los miembros te has encontrado recientemente?\n\nCuando llegue a Japón me encontre con GD y Daesung y comimos “shabu-shabu” (plato hecho en la mesa cocinando los vegetales y trozos de carne en una hervidora). No nos habiamks visto en un tiempo asi que solo hablamos de lo que estuvimos haciendo cada uno. GD fue al tour de Daesung y me dijo que fue espectacular, asi que estuve motivado a trabajar duro tambien.\n\n¿Qué clase de cosas crees que es tierno en una chica?\n\nPara mi es solo la sensación. La verdad no me fijo en su look porque solo miro el aura de la persona. Yo creo que chicas con mi aura favorita/ sentido fresco y puro son tiernas.\n\n¿A que clase de citas quieren ir?\n\nQuiero caminar y ver los cerezos en flor. Los cerezos en flor en japón son hermosos! Realmente no me importa donde iriamos a comer. Si estoy con alguien que me gusta, puedo comer simplemente una bola de arroz (risas).\n\n¿Qué pasa cuando te gusta alguien?\n\nMe vuelvo más cuidadoso en mis palabras y acciones.

BUT im not entirely sure how to represent this like she wears makeup and dresses feminine and everything, but like what would she do about her voice and facial hair?","answer":"Hi Anon,\n\nSince I don’t know anything about your story or the characters background I’m going to assume they have a supportive family, and everyone (Doctors, therapists etc) is okay with her transition.\n\nSo if she started at 13, she would likely have been put on Testosterone blocking medication to stop puberty happening. Because of this, she would not really have to deal with facial hair. Maybe pluck the rare one that might grow, but nothing major.\n\nAs for the voice, with puberty delayed, I’m guessing the voice wouldn’t drop, or drop as much, so would still seem quite feminine.Sorry, I don’t know too much about this, I transitioned at 25, so my voice has already suffered the effects of Testosterone.\n\nTo sum it all up, your character is a girl who is about the same height as other girls, takes a pill every day or two to block Testosterone, has a feminine voice, and looks and dresses like a girl. She might have to get changed for gym class in private, but aside from that, she is just going to look like another girl.\n\nNext year, when she turns 16 (depending on where the book is set), she will have access to Estrogen or the like, so that she starts to go through puberty as a girl.\n\nI hope this help.\n\nSnow","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"zoe-cat","id":96941922602,"post_url":"http://zoe-cat.tumblr.com/post/96941922602/hormones-day-289-september-7th-2014-month-10","slug":"hormones-day-289-september-7th-2014-month-10","type":"photo","date":"2014-09-08 03:25:40 GMT","timestamp":1410146740,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"CTuoCbjx","tags":["daily selfie","hrt selfies","hrt","hormones","trans","transgender","transition","mtf","trans girl","trans woman","dmab","amab","zoe does Renfest"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZzkJYv1QIC5ag","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":66,"caption":"Hormones: Day 289; September 7th, 2014\n\nMonth 10, Week 42\n\nBody is dead.

have been a great article… but it has fallen a ‘bit’ short.\n\n________________\n\nFuturist, pharma tycoon, satellite entrepreneur, philosopher. Martine Rothblatt, the highest-paid female executive in America, was born male. But that is far from the thing that defines her. Just ask her wife. Then ask the robot version of her wife.\n\nOnly about 5 percent of the companies in the Fortune 500 are run by women; double the sample size, and the proportion is the same. Compensation levels for female CEOs appear to lag as well, though it’s hard to tell because there are so few of them. On a recent list of America’s 200 highest-paid CEOs, only 11 were women, and their median pay was $1.6 million less than their male peers. Certain of these women are already household names: Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, No. 34 on the list, who earned $25 million last year, and Hewlett-Packard’s Meg Whitman, No. 95, who earned $17 million. But the highest-paid female CEO in America is not nearly as well known. She is Martine Rothblatt, the 59-year-old founder of United Therapeutics—a publicly traded, Silver Spring, Maryland–based pharmaceutical company—who made a previous fortune as the founder of Sirius Radio, a field she entered as an attorney specializing in the law of space. But what’s really extraordinary about Rothblatt’s ascent is not that she has leaned in, or out, or had any particular thoughts about having it all. What sets Rothblatt apart from the other women on the list is that she—who earned $38 million last year—was born male.\n\n“It’s like winning the lottery,” Rothblatt said happily after seeing her name atop the list during one of the meetings I had with her this summer. But Rothblatt could not be less interested in establishing herself as a role model for women. “I can’t claim that what I have achieved is equivalent to what a woman has achieved. For the first half of my life, I was male.”\n\nIn person, Martine is magnificent, like a tall lanky teenage boy with breasts. She wears no makeup or jewelry, and she inhabits her muted clothing—jeans, a T-shirt, a floppy button-down thrown on top—in the youthful, offhand way of the tech elite. Martine is transgender, a power trans, which makes her an even rarer species in the corporate jungle than a female CEO. And she seems genuinely to revel in her self-built in-betweenness. Just after her sex-reassignment surgery, her appearance was more feminine than it is today—old photos show her wearing lipstick, her long, curly hair loose about her shoulders. But in the years since she has developed her own unisexual style. She is a person for whom gender matters enough to have undergone radical surgery, but not enough to care whether she’s called he or she by people, like her 83-year-old mother, who occasionally lose track of which pronouns to use.\n\nWhat she prefers to be called is “Martine.” To her four young grandchildren she is “Grand Martine.” Bina Aspen, the woman who married Martine 33 years ago, when Martine was a man, and remains her devoted wife, calls herself not straight or gay but “Martine-­sexual”—as in the only person she wants to have sex with is Martine. Together Martine and Bina have four children, and they refer to Martine as “Martine” in conversations with strangers. At home, they call her “Dad.”\n\nIn 1995, just after her transition, Martine published The Apartheid of Sex, a slim manifesto that insisted on an overhaul of “dimorphic” (her word) gender categories. “There are five billion people in the world and five billion unique sexual identities,” she wrote. “Genitals are as irrelevant to one’s role in society as skin tone. Hence, the legal division of people into males and females is as wrong as the legal division of people into black and white races.” Instead, she suggested people might better express their gender and sexual identities on a spectrum, perhaps in terms of color: Green might be “an equally aggressive/nurturing person who does not try to appear sexy” (lime green would be someone a little less aggressive), and purple might be someone gentle, nourishing, and erotic in equal measure.","can_reply":false},{"blog_name":"prisonerofthetimewar","id":96938897065,"post_url":"http://prisonerofthetimewar.tumblr.com/post/96938897065/went-home-today","slug":"went-home-today","type":"text","date":"2014-09-08 02:49:52 GMT","timestamp":1410144592,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"8NFnYgVI","tags":["trans","transman","ftm","coming out","help"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/Z-xtkm1QI0Ywf","followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":false,"note_count":6,"title":"Went home today...","body":"I don’t even know why I thought going home was a good idea.

He even brought up the fact that I’m signing my emails Andy instead of Andie now. \n\nI had pointed out that everyone was good with this and my professors were supportive. His reaction? “they aren’t close to you. they can walk away after this and forget all about it. We cant because we’re the closest too you” so basically he said that no one is actually accepting and never will be?\n\nI don’t know anymore. Everyone keeps telling me to take care of myself.
